'BETTER CARE COULD SAVE HUNDREDS OF BABIES FROM STILLBIRTH, SAYS REPORT The lives of hundreds of unborn babies could be saved if their mothers were given better care in pregnancy, according to a major report.  More than 1,000 babies without any congenital abnormality die at or near term, before labour begins, in the UK every year. A team of experts reviewed in detail a representative sample of 85 of these stillbirths and found there were failures in the care of half of them.  The team found that warning signs were missed. Half the pregnant women whose babies died had told medical staff they were worried that the baby in the womb was no longer moving. In half of those cases, either there was no investigation, the baby’s heart rate was monitored but misinterpreted or staff in the maternity unit failed to respond correctly to warning signs.    Tests that would have alerted staff to the need to monitor the pregnancy more closely were not carried out. Women at risk of developing diabetes were not tested. National guidance for checking that the baby in the womb was growing normally was not followed.  Opportunities to learn from the deaths were not taken – in only a quarter of cases was there an internal review of what had happened and the quality of the reviews was highly variable, said the experts.  Related: What I\'m really thinking: the mother of a stillborn baby  Sands, the charity supporting parents whose babies are stillborn or die soon after birth, took part in the investigation and said there appeared to have been little progress over the last 15 years.  “One in three babies who are stillborn die at term, a time when they are likely to have survived outside the womb had they been safely delivered earlier,” said Judith Abela, the acting chief executive.  “It’s alarming that 15 years after a similar report, there are still critical gaps in antenatal care, suggesting we have learnt very little in the interim. This report confirms the concerns of hundreds of parents Sands supports every year: that not enough is being done to prevent babies from dying.  “Jeremy Hunt pledged last Friday to halve the stillbirth rate by 2030. But this report tells us hundreds of deaths could be avoided today simply by applying existing antenatal guidelines.  “It’s particularly worrying that so many women’s concerns about changes in their baby’s movements are not being taken seriously and that a baby’s poor growth is not being spotted by simple checks.”  The investigations were carried out by a team of academics, clinicians and charity representatives called MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk Through Audits and Confidential Enquiries Across the UK). The work was commissioned by the NHS Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership.  The panel had identified a number of areas where care could be improved, said Elizabeth Draper, professor of perinatal and paediatric epidemiology at University of Leicester, the report’s lead author. But not all the findings were negative.  “We found examples of excellent bereavement care where midwives had provided long-term support for families in a way that surpassed normal expectations, high-quality interpreter services when these were needed, as well as a high standard of postmortems,” she said.  “Giving birth to a stillborn baby is heartbreaking. The report from MBRRACE-UK indicates that opportunities to prevent this may be being missed,” said Prof Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.  The college supports the report’s recommendations for better maternity care, she said. But she also called for more to be done to help pregnant women reduce risky behaviours such as smoking. “Smoking during pregnancy is a major concern as it causes higher rates of stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight and sudden infant death in babies. Smoking among pregnant women in poor and disadvantaged groups and teenage mothers-to-be remains considerably more prevalent than in the general population,” she said.  “Teenagers are almost six times more likely to smoke throughout pregnancy than women who are over 35, and less likely to quit. Obesity is also more prevalent among poor and disadvantaged groups and also carries an increased risk of stillbirth and other poor pregnancy outcomes.  “Government only last week pledged to cut the number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths. We therefore urge government to focus on improving the health of young women in order to safeguard the wellbeing of the next generation.”',1
'SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CRITICIZED AFTER INCIDENTS INVOLVING MIDDLE EASTERN PASSENGERS Southwest Airlines has become the subject of criticism over reports that it singled out Muslim or Middle Eastern passengers on two flights this week, after fellow fliers said Those passengers who made the complaints may have been especially fearful in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the downing of a Russian carrier jet in Egypt, for which the Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility.  Comments made by a number of Republican candidates for the presidency – including poll frontrunners Donald Trump and Ben Carson – have stoked such fears.  Both incidents involving Southwest occurred at Chicago’s Midway airport. In one, on Wednesday night, a Philadelphia pizza shop owner and a friend said they were forced to call police for help after they were asked by a gate agent to step aside in the boarding process, because a passenger was afraid to fly with them after hearing them speak Arabic, according to NBC Philadelphia.  “If that person doesn’t feel safe, let them take the bus,” the pizza shop owner, Maher Khalil, 29, told NBC. “We’re American citizens just like everybody else.”  Khalil said he and Anas Ayyad, 28, both of whom came to the US from the Palestinian territories, felt they had been racially profiled.  “I didn’t know what to do, so I called the cops,” Khalil said.  After being questioned by airport security and the police, he and Ayyad were allowed to board the flight. Khalil said he was thankful to several passengers who stood up for him.  Southwest issued a statement acknowledging that there had been a brief disagreement with two customers.  According to ABC Chicago, a second Southwest flight from Midway was delayed on the same day, when the carrier removed six men of Middle Eastern descent from a plane after passengers protested over their behavior.  In response, Southwest said: “Safety is our primary focus, and our employees are trained to make decisions to ensure that safety, and to safeguard the security of our crews and customers on every flight.”  On Twitter, as news of the incidents spread, several people vowed to stop using the low-cost carrier.  — Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) Any airline that refuses passengers based on religion or ethnicity should be subject to national boycott. Start with @SouthwestAir.  — James S.A. Corey (@JamesSACorey) Dear @SouthwestAir your decision to throw off non threatening Muslim passengers just to sooth someone else\'s racism was disgusting.  — Yair Rosenberg (@Yair_Rosenberg) Wow. Not only did Southwest Airlines let its passengers kick off 6 others for being Muslim, it *defended* doing so: Earlier in the week, the Council on American-Islamic Relations demanded Spirit Airlines apologize after four passengers were removed from a Chicago-bound flight when a passenger raised concerns. At least some of the four reportedly appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent.  “The threshold for ‘see something, say something’ is meant to apply to suspicious behavior, not personal prejudices against minorities engaging in non-suspicious behavior,” the group’s Chicago executive director, Ahmed Rehab, said in a statement.    “That this was escalated into an ordeal seems to be exclusively due to the passenger’s perceived ethnicity.”',0
'HOTEL ATTACK IN MALI REVERSES GAINS IN FIGHT AGAINST EXTREMISM Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  BAMAKO, Mali — The terrorists chose carefully: There are nearly always French, Russian and even a few American visitors to be found in the hotel restaurant, around the pool, in the health club or on the thin black-leather sofas of the glass-fronted lobby, now shattered by gunfire.          With its marble floors, open atrium and lipstick-red lounge, the Radisson Blu Hotel served as a lifeline to the world, a gathering place where diplomats, contractors and others doing business in Mali, one of the poorest countries on earth, could all be found.  Now, bullet holes pockmark the walls and blood is pooled on stairs. The hotel, once a symbol of the international presence in a country trying to emerge from years of upheaval, is the site of a massacre in which terrorists killed 19 people, storming in at breakfast on Friday as terrified diners sprinted into an elevator whose doors did not close in time to save them.  “For those people who did this, they have no sense of the value of life,” President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta said at the foot of the ransacked hotel on Saturday afternoon.  Photo  The brutal attacks in Paris this month were a strike against France’s joie de vivre. The siege of Kenya’s gleaming Westgate mall two years ago was an assault on that country’s rising prosperity, modernity and stability. The terrifying attack on the Radisson Blu here in Mali’s capital was a strike on this nation’s fragile efforts to restore peace after years of fighting.  But in all of these places, the same fundamental question applies: How does a democratic society protect itself from a few determined extremists who can upend an entire nation with a single devastating strike?  “Nobody has found the way to really kick-start a multidimensional approach to countering radicalism,” said Jean-Herve Jezequel, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.  Even in Iraq and Afghanistan, where thousands of lives and billions of dollars have been spent trying to wrest those countries from chaos, extremist forces are flourishing.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  It is a lesson that Mali knows only too well.  Before the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, swept across wide stretches of Syria and Iraq, establishing a self-proclaimed caliphate, black flags flew in Mali.  After a rebellion and military coup plunged the country into disarray, jihadists from across the Sahel charged through northern Mali. They abducted girls and raped them, imposed their harsh version of Islam on the towns they took over, carried out summary executions and destroyed ancient Sufi shrines. They drove out tens of thousands of Malians from their homes, and ruled the northern half of the country for months in 2012 while the rest of the country could do little more than watch.  Photo  Unlike in Syria, the West did not sit on the sidelines while the country disintegrated. France, the former colonial power, put hundreds of boots on the ground, chasing out the extremists from the towns they controlled, scattering them to the desert and killing some of their top leaders, while the United Nations took on the job of working out a peace deal between the government and the rebels.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There are close to 10,000 peacekeepers still in Mali, along with drones that hover over the region. And yet, even after elections and a peace deal to set the country on a new course, extremists have carried out multiple terrorist attacks this year against civilian targets like a restaurant and another hotel, shaking the nation’s faith.  “It means that we’re not over it yet,” said Karim Keïta, the president’s son and the head of Mali’s commission of national defense. “We had a terrorist past, but we’re not over it.”  Witnesses described how easy it was for the gunmen to carry out the attack on the Radisson Blu on Friday, for which militants linked with Al Qaeda claimed responsibility.  Across the street from the hotel, Ibrahim Maiga was in his apartment over his small corner store when he noticed something odd outside his window: a man fishing a few things out of a suitcase that he had opened on the ground.  The man pulled out a grenade, a gun and some other items that Mr. Maiga could not make out. The man then picked up the gun and fired it into the air before walking toward two security guards outside the hotel. He shot one, crossed the road, then shot the other. Both of the men collapsed, Mr. Maiga said. One of them, a friend of Mr. Maiga’s, later died.  Hotel guests were at breakfast around 7 a.m. on the mezzanine level of the hotel when the shots first rang out.  “We heard shooting, pa-pa-pa, from Kalashnikov,” said Ali Yazbeck, 30, the assistant patisserie chef on duty. The head chef shouted that there was an attack, he said. Guests and staff members fled together from the dining room through the kitchen, to a staff elevator at the back of the building.  “The lift takes eight, but there were many more than that,” Mr. Yazbeck recounted from his hospital bed. “The doors would not close.”  A gunman appeared and opened fire. Mr. Yazbeck, a slim man with glasses, was the first to fall, shot in the neck. He prayed silently as the gunman turned to the open elevator and gunned down everyone inside. They were hotel guests, Mr. Yazbeck said: French, Chinese, among others.  Within minutes, the killer returned. For a second time, Mr. Yazbeck feigned death. “I felt shots brushing by my head,” he said. The gunman leaned close and lightly brushed Mr. Yazbeck’s lips with his hand, apparently checking to see if he were still alive. Then he left.  Mr. Yazbeck said he stayed frozen in fear in his hiding place for hours, listening to gunfire and explosions reverberate through the hotel, until security forces eventually rescued him and others around 3 p.m.  The gunmen — Mr. Yazbeck said he saw two in all — were young, 20 or 21, he estimated, and appeared calm. They wore baseball caps. The first was dark-skinned and had a black turban around his neck, he said. The second was lighter skinned. They made no comment or explanation for what they were doing.  The first gunman was laughing when he opened fire on the foreign guests, Mr. Yazbeck said. At one point, the second gunman came into the kitchen and calmly took some meat from the fridge, grilled it and ate it during a break in the killing.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  They targeted foreigners and Malians equally, Mr. Yazbeck said, and did not hesitate to open fire on fellow Muslims (a statement that was at odds with other accounts). “When he saw me, he just fired,” he said. Three of the five hotel staff members on breakfast duty were killed, he said.  During coups and countercoups, violent demonstrations and rebel incursions in the north, the Radisson Blu continued to operate, even when the guest count dwindled to a few rooms.  The tally of those who died hereon Friday is a testament to the global hub the hotel had become: Among them were one American, two Belgians, six Russians and three Chinese. They included a development specialist, railroad construction executives, air cargo employees bringing in machinery, and a foreign government worker in the country for a conference on training Mali’s civil servants.  Still, even with hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and continued international engagement — Mr. Keïta, Mali’s president, was recently received with great pomp in Paris by the French president, with Malian flags adorning the Champs-Élysées — Mali is as troubled as ever, according to analysts.  A political solution for the fractured nation remains elusive, with jihadists rejecting it outright. “Large swaths of territory” remain “devoid of state authority,” leaving armed groups free to commit “abuses with impunity,” Human Rights Watch warned this year.  “There are a lot of actors who continue to threaten,” said Pierre Englebert, an expert on African politics at Pomona College. “We are not far from where we were in 2012 in terms of state weakness.”  For some, the attacks show the limitations of a military-driven approach to fighting terrorism, and how hard it is to find a solution that actually works.  “It’s been 3 years that French are eliminating some extremist leaders, with some success by the way,” said Mr. Jezequel of the crisis group. “But it does not solve the problem.”',0
'WOMEN AND BLACKS MAKE LITTLE PROGRESS AT BIG LAW FIRMS Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Women and blacks have made almost no headway in recent years in increasing their ranks at major United States law firms, according to the latest data from the National Association for Law Placement.  The organization’s annual compilation of legal employer data shows that although women and minorities made small gains at the level of law firm partner this year, the overall percentage of women associates, or entry-level lawyers, dropped in the last five years, and the percentage of African-American associates has declined every year since 2009.  “It’s troubling to see the numbers for women and African-American associates seemingly reversing course,” said James G. Leipold, the association’s executive director. This year, he said, “marks the sixth year of decline in representation of black associates and, while the percentage decrease is small, the overall number itself was small to begin with, so any decline is significant, and the trend is distressing.”  At the partnership level, representation of women and minorities rose slightly this year, compared with 2014. Women accounted for 21.46 percent of partners, up from 21.05 percent last year. Minorities accounted for 7.52 percent, up from 7.33 percent in 2014. Twenty-three years ago, in 1993, when the association first began tracking the numbers, women made up 12.27 percent of partners and minorities accounted for 2.55 percent of partners.  Much of the increase in minority partners since 2009, the report found, comes from a rise in the number of Asian and Hispanic partners. African-Americans made up only 1.7 percent of partners in 2015. Minority women fared better at firms of more than 700 lawyers, holding 3.12 percent of partnerships, but only 2.55 percent of such law firm jobs over all.  Minorities expanded their presence among associate lawyers after being thinned in 2009 because of layoffs resulting from the shaky economy. The number of female associates remained nearly flat over the last three years, settling at 44.68 percent this year, which the association said was the lowest percentage since 2006. The peak number of female associates was in 2009, when they represented 45.66 percent.  “For women too,” Mr. Leipold said, “after years of small gains, the pattern of flat to declining representation among associates in law firms is disturbing.”  It was only in the recruitment of summer associates that law firm numbers compared more favorably to the population of recent law school graduates. According to American Bar Association figures, women have accounted for 46 percent to 49 percent of law school graduates, and minorities accounted for 20 percent and 26 percent of graduates since 2000. Summer associate jobs, however, are essentially two- or three-month tryouts that do not necessarily lead to a full-time associate job.  Although firm records vary widely, with some firms excelling at diversity, Mr. Leipold noted that future gains for women and minorities “are jeopardized by the shrinking pool at the associate level, and it is clear that measuring overall levels of diversity within law firms is inadequate without also looking at representation by specific race and ethnicity.”  The report included information on 113,000 partners, associates and other lawyers in 1,081 law firm offices.',1
'MORE WOMEN ON TECH BOARDS, BUT INDUSTRY LAGS Sheryl Sandberg is chief operating officer of Facebook and sits on the board of the giant social network. (Photo: Eric Risberg, Associated Press)  SAN FRANCISCO — More women sit on the boards of technology companies, but the industry continues to lag other sectors on diversity.  The percentage of women on boards at S&P 500 technology companies increased to 18.3% in 2014 from 13.7% in 2010, according to a new report from Equilar, the executive, board and governance data firm. That\'s the second-lowest representation of female board members of any industry after the basic materials sector.  Overall, nearly 20% of directors on S&P 500 boards were female in 2014, up from 15.7% in 2010, the report says.  "Diversity on boards isn\'t just about checking a box. The fact that nearly every company in the S&P 500 has at least one woman on their boards but less than one in five directors are women means that there are a lot of boards out there that view diversity as a one and done type of situation," said Dan Marcec, director of content for Equilar. "While the average board size is nearly 11 members, the average number of women on those boards is just over two."  Institutional investors are pushing for corporate boards to better reflect the demographics of the people their companies serve. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System and BlackRock, the world\'s largest asset manager, issued guidelines in 2015 that underscored the importance of diversity on corporate boards.  "It is about ensuring companies keep up with a changing customer base. Companies wishing to remain competitive in the global economy will benefit from drawing on diverse experiences and perspectives that reflect a changing customer base," California State Treasurer and CalSTRS board member John Chiang wrote in a letter earlier this year.  "A diverse board makeup improves employee morale and productivity and sends a message to employees throughout the organization that a company is committed to the advancement of women and minorities. At the same time, it enhances a company’s reputation and attractiveness at a time when many investors are increasingly using a variety of nonfinancial metrics, such as board diversity, as criteria in investment decision-making," Chiang wrote.  The tech industry is wrestling with a chronic lack of diversity from the highest corporate ranks to the rank and file.  New efforts are targeting the shortage of women at the top of the tech industry. Boardlist, for example, is a database that privately held companies can search to find female candidates to fill open board seats. Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, chairman and founder of Silicon Valley startup Joyus, is spearheading the project to increase the representation of women.  In 2014, 29 tech companies in the S&P 500 had corporate boards with more than one in five females, an increase from 17 companies in 2010, according to Equilar. Frontier Communications led the list with five women out of 12 directors in 2014, the only company to top 40% representation.  Five tech companies had no women on their boards in 2014 compared with 15 in 2010, according to the Equilar report which was created using BoardEdge, a database with information on more than 135,000 U.S. board members.  The biggest public pressure is on household names such as Facebook, Apple and Google.  "Even though it\'s an equally important issue across corporate America, diversity is a very public issue for consumer-facing companies in general and tech companies in particular, since many of them openly state their mission to have the best interest of the public at heart," Marcec said.  Apple\'s board was 29% female in 2014, Google\'s was 27%.  In 2012, when Facebook was on the verge of its initial public offering, activists campaigned for the company to add a woman to its board. More than half of Facebook\'s users are women, and women are more active users of Facebook than men, making them a lucrative demographic for the giant social network. Facebook has since added two women to the board: Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, author of the international bestseller Lean In, and Susan Desmond-Hellmann, chief executive of The Gates Foundation.  "Even though just 25% of Facebook’s board is female, that is well above the S&P 500 average and in the top 25% of tech companies," Marcec said.',1
'TRANSIT RIDERS UNFAZED BY NEW YORK TERROR THREATS Should commuters be worried about ISIS threats against New York?  Police officers with the New York City Police (NYPD) Emergency Services Unit stand guard in front of Macy\'s at Herald Square on November 20, 2015 in New York. Police officials are on a heightened state after the Islamic State group released a video using old footage of busy Manhattan streets to threaten an attack. (Photo: Timothy Clary/Getty Images)  Days after the Paris terrorist attacks killed more than 129 people, the entire world is seemingly on high alert — and nowhere more so than New York.  At New York Penn Station on Friday, the security was instantly noticeable. While the terminal is littered with police stations, groups of uniformed police officers were also positioned around major meeting points and well-traveled hallways. At a train station where 600,000 people each day keep moving, they stick out like a sore thumb, standing perfectly still.  "In the city, I guess I’m a little more worried — like when you\'re on the subway," Aberdeen resident William Gallagher said. "New York is where you really notice them. You learn to keep your eyes open and that\'s when you notice how beefed up the security is."  Officers from at least five different departments — New York City, state, Amtrak, Department of Homeland Security and the National Guard — could be seen throughout the terminal. Some wore bulletproof vests, others in traditional law enforcement uniforms, and a few had bomb-sniffing dogs on a leash.  All were armed.  “You see the National Guard, the special units with M-16 (rifles), the whole bit,” Gallagher said. “It’s better to have them there than not.”  And while Newark Penn Station is a much smaller terminal, the NJ Transit police presence could be felt even more. Officers were stationed throughout the 5-acre building, at information desks and near track entrances.  With all the beefed up security, nearly all of the NJ Transit commuters riders waiting outside the Aberdeen-Matawan train station on Friday morning said the terrorist threats made against New York wouldn\'t change their routine.  "We\'ve been living with this kind of stuff since 9/11," said Manny Pearson. "It\'s nothing new. There\'s probably been more of a presence the last few days, but that\'s what you expect."  “I haven’t really noticed,” said  Charlotte Johnson, who was catching a Newark-bound train from the Aberdeen-Matawan station, said she hadn’t noticed the increased security.  “My face is either in a book or just looking somewhere else,” she said.  That\'s exactly the message that New York City officials want to hear.  "New Yorkers won\'t live in fear and people should continue to go to work, live their lives, and enjoy the greatest city in the world," Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement this week.  After the terror attack in Paris, the NYPD implemented its 500-member Critical Response Command unit, specifically trained and armed for counterterrorism. Uniformed officers are everywhere, not just at the transit hubs, but on the streets as well. Police officers armed with assault rifles, and some with police dogs, for example, were standing outside Macy\'s at Herald Square.  Speaking on radio Friday, de Blasio said the critical response unit encompassed more than uniformed officers.  "There are cameras in lots of different places,” he said. “There are undercovers in lots of different places. There\'s a stream of intelligence we have that helps us know if there’s something we have to prevent against. "  Similarly, NJ Transit spokeswoman Jennifer Nelson said the agency\'s "police department has been and continues to closely monitor the situations and developments around the world and will act accordingly."  That comes as a comfort to those who ride the trains. Even as commuters say the threats won\'t affect their daily routines, that doesn\'t mean they\'re not thinking about it.  “I’m concerned every day,” Johnson said. “You just never know what’s going to happen. You can walk outside and something bad can happen.”',0
'THE STATES WHERE BALLOT INITIATIVES COULD THREATEN LEGAL ABORTION IN 2014 In this March 25, 2013 photo, Kris Kitko, left, leads chants of protest at an abortion-rights rally at the state Capitol in Bismarck, N.D. | ASSOCIATED PRESS  On Nov. 4, as voters across the U.S. head to the ballot box, Americans in three states will be voting on legislation that could seriously undermine access to legal abortion.  More restrictions on abortion were passed between 2011 and 2013 than in the entire preceding decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute. And 2014 is keeping up with that trend. Although the Supreme Court blocked key parts of Texas\' harsh anti-abortion law just yesterday, in this year\'s midterm elections, Colorado, Tennessee and North Dakota will have constitutional amendments on their ballots that could effectively eliminate -- or at least significantly chip away at -- abortion rights in those states.  Two states, Colorado and North Dakota, will have personhood measures on their ballots. This type of legislation seeks to legally define life as starting at conception, thus extending legal rights to fertilized eggs.  Advocates of personhood legislation claim that the laws are intended to protect women and their babies. "You know, the 14th Amendment requires equal protection under the law for everybody," Personhood USA representative Jennifer Mason told NPR in November 2013. "And so we believe that every human being, regardless of their location, whether they\'re in the womb or out of it, deserves those protections and those rights."  In Tennessee, an amendment on the November ballot would allow the state legislature to pass anti-abortion legislation more easily.  Women\'s reproductive health advocates point to the impact these measures could have on the rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes personhood measures, stating that they "erode women\'s basic rights to privacy and bodily integrity; deny women access to the full spectrum of preventive health care including contraception; and undermine the doctor-patient relationship."  "The goal of all of these measures is to ban abortion and to restrict access to contraception, and to essentially put politicians between women and doctors," NARAL Pro-Choice America Political Director Erika West told The Huffington Post in a phone interview.  Here are the states where anti-abortion constitutional amendments will be on the ballot this November:  Colorado: Amendment 67  What It Says: The measure states that, "In the interest of the protection of pregnant mothers and their unborn children from criminal offenses and neglect and wrongful acts, the words person and child in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act must include unborn human beings."  What Proponents Claim It\'s For: In August, Mason told The Washington Post: “Amendment 67 corrects the loophole in Colorado law and ensures that those criminals can be charged with killing a child in many different scenarios, whereas previous personhood amendments didn’t address the criminal code.”  What Opponents Say It Could Mean For Women: Those who oppose the bill say that by changing the definition of personhood in Colorado\'s criminal code, the amendment could effectively criminalize abortion. It could also call into question the legality of certain types of birth control, including the pill, intrauterine devices and emergency contraception.  Opponents also worry that the amendment could have even further-reaching consequences for women who miscarry or deliver a stillborn child, as well as their doctors. "The language of Amendment 67 is so broad and far-reaching that it would make pregnant women and their doctors criminally liable for any pregnancy that does not result in a live birth, regardless of the stage of pregnancy," reads the FAQ section on the website of NO67, a campaign that opposes the measure.  North Dakota: Measure 1  What It Says: The measure would add the following to Article 1 of the North Dakota state constitution: "The inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected."  What Proponents Claim It\'s For: Personhood USA\'s website says that the measure is meant to "ensure that mother and baby are both treated as medical patients." And in February 2013, Republican state Sen. Margaret Sitte, the sponsor of the personhood initiative, told HuffPost\'s Laura Bassett: "We are intending that it be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, since Scalia said that the Supreme Court is waiting for states to raise a case."  What Opponents Say It Could Mean For Women: West said that the North Dakota measure, like the Colorado amendment, could lead to an abortion ban and have negative implications for the legality of certain types of birth control and IVF procedures. Other opponents of Measure 1 point to its confusing language. "Because Measure 1 is so vague and poorly-worded, it will lead to so many legal battles," Karla Rose Hanson, spokesperson for North Dakotans Against Measure 1, told Cosmopolitan in September.  "It could lead to court battles on a variety of fronts -- how it applies to end-of-life situations, how it applies to IVF, how it applies to abortion."  Tennessee: Amendment 1  What It Says: The amendment would add the following language to Tennessee\'s constitution: "Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother."  What Proponents Claim It\'s For: The group Yes On 1 says that Amendment 1 would pave the way for the Tennessee legislature to "enforce common sense protections for abortion-vulnerable women or unborn children." Since a 2000 state Supreme Court ruling that a woman\'s constitutional right to privacy included the right to terminate a pregnancy, the Tennessee legislature has not been able to pass broad anti-abortion legislation.  What Opponents Say It Could Mean For Women: If the amendment passes, it will effectively invalidate the earlier state Supreme Court ruling, and allow Tennessee\'s Congress to pursue -- and pass -- more aggressive anti-abortion legislation. According to West, the amendment would allow the legislature "to appeal every measure that protects abortion rights."  "We’ll see an immediate barrage of legislation that mirrors what we’ve seen in other states where clinics have closed en masse, like in Texas and Virginia," West added.',1
'HALF OF THE AMAZON\'S TREE SPECIES ARE THREATENED It\'s been estimated that the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas are—or once were—home to upwards of 11,000 different tree species. It\'s also been estimated that those forests have shrunk by about 12 percent, and that human meddling could double or triple that number by 2050. Now, researchers report, the loss of forest cover could threaten the existence of more than half the tree species in the Amazon.  The Amazon basin hosts perhaps the greatest biodiversity on Earth—so much so that researchers know relatively little about many of the region\'s native species. "While we know quite a bit about Amazonian deforestation, we know little about the effects on the Amazonian [tree] species," says lead author Hans ter Steege, a senior research fellow at Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, the Netherlands.  "We\'ve never had a good idea about how many species are threatened in the Amazon, and now with this study we have an estimate," adds study co-author Nigel Pitman, a senior conservation ecologist at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois.  To get a picture of the health of forests in the Amazon basin and the Guiana Shield north of Brazil, a team of 160 botanists, ecologists, and taxonomists from 97 institutions went out into the field and, well, started counting. The team ultimately mapped 4,953 "relatively common" tree species at 1,485 sites throughout the region. Using a standard model of biodiversity, the researchers inferred the existence of another 10,000 species, which they assumed were largely hidden in the densest Amazonian forests, but rare enough that even a careful accounting could have missed them.  Hans ter Steege and his colleagues next compared species maps with maps of deforested and protected areas, then computed how many trees of each species could be lost under two different chain of events: a business-as-usual scenario, in which deforestation continues more or less as it has been for decades, and 40 percent of the Amazon\'s trees would be gone by 2050; and a less severe scenario, in which governments step up protections, and deforestation tops out at 20 percent.  Under the business-as-usual scenario, 51 percent of the Amazon\'s common tree species\' populations and 43 percent of rare tree species\' populations would decline by 30 percent or more, qualifying them for inclusion on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\'s "Red List" of threatened species. Even under the less severe scenario in which forest governance improves, 16 percent of common species and 25 percent of rare species qualify for the Red List.  Those losses would likely affect iconic tree species including Brazil nut, cacao, and açai palm, which play central roles in the regional economy. What\'s more, Amazonian forests help trap a vast amount of carbon, which, if unleashed through deforestation, could exacerbate an already warming climate. "We want to make sure the Amazon keeps the carbon sink," ter Steege says. "This is important."  This story was originally published by Pacific Standard.

'NIH PROMISES TO RETIRE ALL RESEARCH CHIMPS Story highlights NIH reverses stance and will no longer keep chimpanzees for potential future medical research  All of the agency\'s nearly 300 chimps will eventually retire to a federally-approved chimp sanctuary  (CNN) The National Institutes of Health says it plans to retire all government research chimpanzees to sanctuaries, reversing its stance of many years. The NIH had said a set of chimps needed to be kept for future medical experimentation.  JUST WATCHED Chimps promised retirement stuck waiting in labs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chimps promised retirement stuck waiting in labs 02:57  About 300 chimps will be retired over the next two years, or possibly longer, according to Cathy Spraetz, director of Chimp Haven in Louisiana, the nation\'s only federally-approved chimp sanctuary.  "It\'s fabulous. We\'re overjoyed," said Spraetz.  The NIH\'s decision follows a CNN investigation in February that found the agency had fallen woefully behind in retiring chimpanzees. Only six of 310 research chimps promised retirement in June 2013 had been allowed to leave government research facilities, and the agency had no timetable for when it would retire the rest of the animals.  Research chimpanzees are kept at laboratories and holding facilities.  Many of the chimps had been intentionally infected with diseases such as hepatitis or HIV -- or both -- for the sake of medical science, and dozens had died waiting to be retired to Chimp Haven, which has acres of forest where the chimps can roam.',0
'WOMEN WILL GET EQUAL PAY … IN 118 YEARS Progress to close the gender pay gap around the world has all but stopped since the 2008 economic crash and it will be more than 100 years before women can expect equal pay with men, according to the latest global figures.  Women’s pay still lags nearly a decade behind, according to the World Economic Forum, meaning that what they are paid now on average is the equivalent of what men were paid in 2006. And the outlook is gloomy: at current rates of change, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates it will be 118 years before women around the world can expect equal pay.  The pay penalty for being a woman has barely improved since 2008, the start of the global financial crisis, though the researchers say it is too soon to say if there is a link. Another theory is that even where political and business policies are improving, many employers still organise the working day around the stereotypes of women as caregivers at home and men as breadwinners at work.  Related: Unequal pay: the life cycle of a woman\'s earning power  Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, which campaigns on gender parity, warned on Wednesday that equality would matter more and more as computers took over the economy.  “We need to create a world where women’s contributions and ideals are as valued as those of men,” Schwab said. “Gender parity in our thinking and actions will be critical in helping to ensure that the future is served by humanity and not threatened by it.”  The WEF, famous for its annual winter gathering of the world’s richest and most powerful people in the Swiss resort of Davos, is publishing its 10th annual report on gender parity. The latest figures calculate that the average full-time salary for a working woman is $11,102 a year – little more than half the male average of $20,554. This almost matches men’s average income in 2006, which the WEF estimated at $11,351 (women’s pay then was $6,117).  Adjusted for inflation, the picture is worse: in today’s money, men were earning more than $13,000 in 2006 – but because it was the first year of the WEF report they cannot say how much more than a decade behind that would put women’s incomes.  The pay figures are part of the WEF’s annual report on all aspects of the gender gap, which also covers education, health and political empowerment. Based on scores for dozens of those indicators, Iceland comes out top, followed by Norway, Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Rwanda. The UK comes 18th, the US is 28th, and Australia is back at 36th.  As well as the moral, rights-driven pressure to narrow the gaps, pay discrimination between men and women is a loss to employers and the wider economy, according to Willem Adema, senior economist for the OECD, the international economic thinktank.  “It’s the same with all sorts of discrimination, whether it’s of a sexual orientation or whatever,” Adema said. “If discrimination means people not pursuing individual aspirations to the full … the economy loses out on a lot of talent.”  Global averages inevitably mask huge differences between countries and even regions. Nordic countries dominate the list for all measures, including pay.    However, top performers are not all predictable. For comparing average total incomes for men and women, eight countries appear to have reached parity, but those figures will be distorted because the survey does not measure average incomes above $40,000. Of those countries where proper comparisons can be made, Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana and Vietnam come out on top. Algeria, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and India are the worst performers.    The list of countries that have best succeeded in closing the gap between men and women in the economy – which also includes the rate of women working and in leadership roles – is topped by Bolivia, France, Nicaragua and Ecuador. Nordic countries, despite having topped the league 10 years ago, have also continued to go further than most to improve the lot of women who want to work.  Pay for women has traditionally been depressed by the fact that so many more women than men work in low-paid public sector and “caring” professions, and do part-time work, which is often in low-pay sectors.  However, the WEF report also finds a wide gap between the rates of pay for men and women doing the same work: for every $1 earned by a man, researchers estimate that, on average, a woman will get little more than 60 cents.  The country that scores best for paying men and women most equally for similar work is Rwanda, while Zambia is third and Albania fifth. The worst scores are for Angola, Brazil, France, Chile and Argentina.    Solutions to the continuing gender gap in pay fall into three categories, according to Saadia Zahidi, a member of WEF’s executive committee and the lead author of the report. She listed regulations banning outright discrimination; improving parental leave, childcare and tax policy; and changing incentives for companies to improve their performance, including a voluntary agreement (to avoid legislation) by the UK’s biggest public companies to work towards having at least 25% women on their boards.  She also pointed to Turkey’s experiment with tax breaks for businesses that employ more women; and companies trying out their own policies, such as Coca-Cola making special efforts to support female suppliers and distributors. Some companies are also trialling mentoring – including younger women mentoring older male colleagues to help them understand the changes.  Zahidi also believes a growing focus on the need for “caring” professions will put a premium on wages in those sectors, where women are dominant.  Perversely, in some countries women are losing out because maternity and childcare policies are so generous they are taking more time out of their careers.  Adema said this needed to be addressed by more shared parental leave between mothers and fathers – an emerging trend. Iceland and Germany were among the first countries to do this, and Japan and South Korea have enacted similar legislation in the past two years, but it is too soon to see the effect.  “Whether we’ll ever get full employment is another question,” said Adema. “But young professionals now expect their partner to play his role: that will be one driver to greater equality.”  The good, the bad and the improvers:  Denmark  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Central Copenhagen. Denmark offers 75% subsidised daycare to families. Photograph: Alamy  Denmark has a reputation for gender equality, with a strong welfare state and 75% subsidised daycare, enabling at least three-quarters of women to work. But new figures show there is still a gender pay gap of 16.4%, and a campaign raising the ideas of women striking from 10 November – in effect the last day of the year on which they are paid for their work – was shared 180,000 times on Facebook.  Ole Just, an economist for HK, Denmark’s largest employment union, said: “Even though Denmark’s figure is low compared with other countries, the gap is still too big – it’s not good enough.”  Mona Larsen, of the Danish National Centre for Social Research, agreed: “It’s not great for women at the moment, and if the trend continues it will be 111 years before there are equal wages between men and women in Denmark.”  So why are Danish women still having to mind the gap? “It’s partly because there aren’t many women on company boards in Denmark (just 17%), so fewer women earn the big salaries,” said Larsen. “Men and women have similar educational levels in Denmark (60% of all graduates are female), but women are using their education in different ways, with more choosing to go into the public sector, where pay is lower.”  Danish women spend fewer hours in the office than men and take on more duties at home, too.  Researchers from Aarhus University found that highly skilled Danish women do more household activities than their US peers and are far less likely to outsource housework. High taxes mean that a cleaner can set you back 250 kroner (£24) an hour, and egalitarian norms make paying someone else to do your dirty work an ethical grey area in Denmark.  The same systems that help Danish women balance family and work may also be hindering them. Marie Busck, corporate social responsibility and compliance officer at the Danish retail company Tiger, said: “We have social security and childcare that makes it easy for mothers to work, but it’s still mostly women taking time off to look after children.  “Parents get 52 weeks’ leave for a new baby, but if it’s predominantly mothers taking it and they have two children, then they’re out of the workplace for two years.”  Busck believes this has a big impact on women’s careers and stops some reaching more senior positions: “Middle management is split more equally, but at the top there’s a big difference in the number of women and men.”  As well as encouraging women to the top, Larsen wants more to go into the private sector. “Women should be being paid as much for their education as men,” she said. “This way we can stop certain occupations becoming ‘gendered’.”  And the first step? “Better pay transparency – so women know what to aim for.” Helen Russell in Jutland, Denmark  Botswana  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Research technicians in Gaborone, Botswana, where the gender pay gap is closing. Photograph: Jon Hrusa/EPA  In Botswana, men still earn more than women, but the situation is improving rapidly. A proactive women’s movement and a receptive government have combined to narrow the gender pay gap considerably in this upper-middle-income country.  “I think the gender pay gap is not a problem in Botswana. It used to be, but not now,” said Ida Mokereitane, executive director of Emang Basadi, a women’s rights group.  Mokereitane credits this to serious legislative reform, such as an amended employment act which recognises “the desirability of eliminating discrimination between the sexes in respect of wages for equal work”.    “It is maybe not 100% fixed, but in general women now have the same opportunities as men,” she said. “We’ve also been seeing a lot of changes, where in positions of decision-making there are a lot more women, in the public and private sector.”  The situation was not always so good. A 2001 academic study found that “female employees in Botswana’s labour market [were] on average better educated than their male counterparts yet on average they [earned] much less than their male counterparts”.    Bridget Senthufhe, office manager for an international NGO, said: “I have experienced it in my career, where my male counterparts earned more than me. They earned a lot more. I worked in human resources so I saw that.”  Pat Smythe, head of a Gaborone-based human resources firm, said significant improvements had been made. “There’s a difference globally in the pay of men and women, whether we want to admit it or not, but Botswana is one of the better countries.  “Although the country is still no closer to having a female president, there has been a big improvement in the wage gap between the genders. The gap is now 5% or less.” In neighbouring South Africa the figure is between 15% and 20%, he pointed out.  Smythe attributes the improvement to intensive lobbying by women’s groups and influential women within political movements. He also argues that President Ian Khama is more receptive to reform than his predecessors.  A further statement of intent is the appointment of Pearl Matome as permanent secretary for labour and immigration, one of a handful of women in such a senior government post.  “She’s in a critical position that can influence the total elimination of that gender gap,” said Smythe. Simon Allison in Johannesburg  Ecuador  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, who has vowed to promote wage equality. Photograph: Dolores Ochoa/AP  According to the WEF, Ecuador has been a trailblazer for reducing the gender pay gap over the past 10 years.  The government of Rafael Correa has taken action to promote equality. Last March, in commemoration of International Women’s Day, the labour minister, Carlos Marx Carrasco, and UN Women representative in Ecuador, Moni Pizani, signed an agreement that both organisations would work on policies and projects to reduce pay differences.    In a report this month in El Universo newspaper, Pizani said Ecuadorian women were paid between 17% and 24% less than men, and that the gap was widest in rural areas.  Delia Lema, a 26-year-old woman from the Chimborazo province, told the newspaper that when her husband found a better-paid job, his former employer – the manager of a farm – denied her the chance to replace him, claiming she would not be as productive as her husband.  City women describe a similar kind of discrimination. Daniela Salazar, a lawyer and deputy dean at a private university in Quito, said that in the six years she had been teaching, her responsibilities had grown disproportionately in relation to her pay.  “When we mention that we need to leave work at a certain time, or that we cannot go to a certain event because we have responsibilities in our homes, it is perceived as if our dedication to our work is not absolute,” she said. “That is one of the reasons why we don’t receive similar remuneration to men”.  Last April, a law was introduced stating that an employer could not lay off a pregnant women. The law also penalised untimely and discriminatory layoffs.  But despite the new legislation and the fact that more women are working in areas previously dominated by men, women still feel that employers perceive their gender as a disadvantage, and even as a disqualification, when hiring.  For Gabriela Salinas, commercial manager of a publishing company, the gender pay gap is particularly evident on the top rungs of the corporate world. “I’ve never experienced being paid less for being a woman, but men do get more opportunities to exercise senior management positions and, of course, they are also better paid than women in the same positions.” Marcela Ribadeneira  Italy  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Women demonstrating in Rome in 2011 against the sex scandals involving former leader Silvio Berlusconi, which they said had hurt their dignity and reinforced outdated gender stereotypes. Photograph: Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters  Francesca Villanti, director of exhibitions at the Complesso del Vittoriano in Rome, thinks Italy has come a long way on the rights of working women and does not see much evidence of discrimination on the job – with one stark exception.  “Once a woman gets pregnant, then it’s over,” she said. “As soon as she gets pregnant it is almost impossible to get a job or go back to work.”  When it comes to pay equality, Italy ranks a lowly 127 out of 145 countries, and 92nd for the gap in overall pay, according to WEF data. Experts on gender issues and female executives point to a confluence of what they call “cultural issues” at the heart of the problem.  Italy ranks poorly not only on pay standards, but also on the number of women who are working. According to OECD data, it has the third lowest female labour participation rate (51% ) among OECD countries, after Turkey and Mexico.  Many people point to a striking lack of support when it comes to childcare, where women are still viewed as the main caregivers. Less than 30% of children under the age of three attend daycare, suggesting a lack of childcare options.  “Most of the burden is shouldered by women,” said Francesco Grillo, a political economist and managing director of Vision and Value, a consulting firm. “This probably explains the rather large gap Italy has in terms of the employment rate of women.”  When women do work, it is often in part-time or lower-paying jobs. And the hurdles faced by young women with children mean few rise to the top of their fields.  For parents who do leave children in daycare, there is often an assumption that women can take many days off as their offspring settle in. The so-called inserimento, in which a child spends only a few hours at a time in daycare, with a parent nearby, is a familiar and frustrating rite of passage for working mothers that can take up to four weeks.    Stefania Todisco, who works for an Italian television broadcaster, believes Italy is about 30 years behind other western countries when it comes to women having equal rights and pay, which she attributes to Italian women not getting the right to vote until 1945. “In 30 years women could have the same position as other countries,” she said. “In every top level right now, women are absent.”  But there is a potential bright spot. Women are taking more prominent roles in government and politics, even if their numbers are not significantly increasing in business and other areas.  Thanks in part to a quota rosa that is forcing more gender equity in government, many advocates for gender and pay equity think the changing public face of government will eventually lead to legislation that supports working women, and that pay will follow.

'PREGNANCY, THE HARDEST RACE OF ALL: \'IF MISCARRIAGE IS SO COMMON, WHY DOES NO ONE TALK ABOUT IT?\' “There’s no heartbeat,” the nurse said.    Earlier that year, I had finally accepted that my 40th birthday was not going to magically go away. Nature was not to be messed with and time was running out if we wanted to start a family. A couple of months before, chest issues and a health scare forced me to opt out of my big race, a 100km alpine challenge. As a non-running runner, I had developed multiple variations of talking about my health issues – most of which were engineered to make the scare sound like a niggle. I didn’t want to appear weak or fragile and didn’t let the lack of training eat up too much of my mental resolve. However, the night before the race, fear started creeping in as I was staring at my neatly packed race bag: what if my heart gave up in the middle of the night, up in the misty mountains? Was a race a risk worth taking? Through teary eyes, I could also picture a life worth living – one with a cabin in the woods and children running around. With a heavy heart, I resolved to let go of the dream of finishing my first 100km before the adventure of motherhood.    I got pregnant immediately, which gave me confidence that my body was not broken and allayed my health anxiety. The first scan revealed the miracle of life growing inside me and despite a massive panic about where we would find the money and time to add this adventure to the three businesses we were running, I started to relax into this new role. As an ambitious and competitive woman, motherhood had always scared me. I saw it as a brake, as sand in the machine. I had desperately hoped that age would bring the desire to create life that everyone else seemed to experience, but instead there were always more ideas to bring to the world, more opportunities to develop businesses, more challenges to solve – and more races to run.    Pregnancy unexpectedly gave me licence to relax. I had a new challenge, I was blown out of my comfort zone, and I liked it. I initially found it hard to accept the changes my body was undergoing. The belly, the boobs, the urge to pee – not the ideal combination to keep running. I went to yoga and walked instead, trying to be the best I could be at protecting life. Most difficult was to refrain from telling everyone. At 11 weeks, my belly was starting to show and going to business meetings or public events involved looser clothes and strategically placed bags. I couldn’t wait for my 40th birthday, which coincidentally was the day we would be able to reveal all, and the day I could stop making poor excuses for not going running.    But it wasn’t to be. The baby had stopped growing at 11-and-a-half weeks and my body had not bothered telling me. A second scan confirmed the diagnosis. Shock followed. We had gone into the 12-week scan in such utter naivety that six months later, I still feel stupid. We had never heard of “missed miscarriage” before, and naively expected that if you lose a baby, there will immediately be physiological signs. We also had no idea that one in four pregnancies will end within 12 weeks, most within the first few days.    Marathon double Olympian and Commonwealth medallist Liz Yelling is part of the sad statistics. “Unfortunately, I had failed to make the GB team for the London Olympics, so that year we decided to add to our family. I fell pregnant fairly quickly and the week before the Olympics I was 11-and-a-half weeks pregnant.” Wanting to be part of the Olympics marathon experience in one way or another, Yelling had agreed to be part of the live commentating team for BBC TV. But two days before the marathon, the bleeding started.    “We went to the hospital and they told us that we had lost the baby, that it wasn’t a viable pregnancy. They offered me the option to have an operation the week after or to let nature take its course; I thought I would just leave it and see what happens.”    By Sunday morning, the bleeding had petered out and Yelling headed out to the BBC commentating booth – with a change of clothes just in case. Unfortunately, when the race started, a familiar “warm gush feeling” showed that the bleeding had only just started and it got much worse. “I was live on TV and kept excusing myself to disappear into a portaloo outside, which is not ideal. I had kept pushing the issue to one side as I wanted to keep doing what I had committed to. I must have been to the toilet about four times before I accepted that I just had to explain what was happening.”  “Of course, it was quite ironic: it was the event that I had ran in the last Olympics and that I really wanted to be part of in some way. My grief at the loss of the baby had turned into anger; that the miscarriage was also affecting something so significant for me made it the most awful moment in my life.”  Like Liz, I too felt angry and betrayed. Unlike Liz’s, my body had not warned me about what had happened. In a small minority of cases, there are no signs of miscarriage, such as bleeding or cramping, and the unviable pregnancy is only discovered by a scan. Those are called the missed miscarriages. After the initial shock of losing the baby, the weight of failure and sadness compeletely engulfed me. My 40th birthday was spent waiting for nature to take its course. The feeling that dominated those first few days though was, unexpectedly, shame. I had failed to care for the baby where most people – seemingly – succeed with ease. I had been presumptuous to believe that all was going to be OK.  As Liz said, “Everyone knows that there is a higher risk of miscarriage in the first 12 weeks, but if you’re fit and healthy, you don’t necessarily think that it’s going to happen to you – especially if you’re told that you’re a low-risk pregnancy.” Indeed, I too felt like I had been given a false sense of confidence by the midwife, who didn’t once mention the risks of miscarriage, especially after a first scan at seven weeks showed a healthy baby with a strong heartbeat.  According to research published by the Miscarriage Association, if you see a heartbeat at eight weeks, the chances of the pregnancy continuing are 98%. Is it normal therefore to feel confident and positive about the pregnancy, or is it downright arrogant? I wonder whether shame is the reason why so few women (and even fewer men) talk about their experiences of miscarriage, thereby perpetuating the taboo.  “If it’s that common, why does no one talk about it before it happens?” Liz says. As a professional athlete, while trying to conceive and in early pregnancy, she had to fence off the daily litany of questions about her running plans. “People would ask ‘What’s your next race?’ or ‘What’s your next target?’ and I would say ‘I’m retiring’ or ‘I’m taking some time off’. I found it quite difficult to explain that actually I wanted to be a mum and do something different, and that running was not my main focus any more. It’s almost easier to make up an injury and lie. I used to just dress it up and say that I was taking time off mentally and physically before setting new targets. Of course, when you then announce that you’re pregnant, people are like ‘Ah, I get it now!’”  Hence the problem when you lose the baby and never get to “come out”. More than once, it was tempting to commit what seems to be a social faux pas and tell everyone about what had happened. As the publisher of an independent running magazine, I didn’t want fellow runners to assume that I wasn’t taking my running seriously, or that I had turned lazy and grumpy – because that’s what grief could look like. “Runners can forget that running is not everything to everyone. There are ebbs and flows, and you’re not necessarily running or racing or training all the time,” says Yelling.  Even when not trying to conceive, at some point or another, female runners generally will be impacted by their menstrual cycles when it comes to training and racing. Anna Frost – the New Zealand ultra-runner who regularly tops the podiums of the hardest mountain races on the planet – knows a thing or two about woman-specific training. In front of a captive audience at a female-only trail running workshop in Wales, “Frosty” (as she’s affectionately known among her followers) said that, although she had long observed the impact of her cycle on her performance, she struggled to find any resource or research to help her train better. Months of study of her luteal phase, linked with her training log, led her to be much more attuned to her body. Learning to run “with” and not “against” her cycles has “taken the pressure off, mentally and physically. We [women] have to be aware and conscious of who we are and then celebrate that instead of keeping pushing through pain or stress when we really don’t need to. My recovery is better, I don’t get PMS and my running through this time is so much more enjoyable.”  I have never heard an elite athlete say that they had a bad race because of their period. Yelling admits that “within team GB, because we did so much running, we might have been more attuned to our bodies than amateur runners – we would notice performance differences and we would discuss those things. I actually researched the topic a while ago and noticed that there’s very, very little research done on the subject.” Frost agrees that “it seems crazy that there is not more information. In the previously male-dominated sport of trail running, which has grown so big so quickly, more and more women are becoming empowered and we now realise that we are different and need different things from men. It is hard to research menstrual cycles, there are so many variables, but it needs to be done.”  Doctors will tell you not to run after a miscarriage, a double whammy as you lose the very thing that allows you to keep your mind clear, ease the mental pain and rebuild your confidence. My own running started again when I was invited to run a mountain marathon and decided to toe the start line despite a six-month running hiatus. The punishing uphill forced me to move in silence and, as we hiked towards the summits, I found inner peace and joy. It wasn’t just the incredible scenery or the thin air that got me dizzy, but the realisation that my body was once again capable of great feats of endurance. That day, I got my mojo back and some sense of future possibilities.  About 10 days after she miscarried, Liz, too, had to go for a little run. “I had all that energy from watching the Olympics and I think that running helped me find myself again; you can feel a bit lost and it’s good to go back to what you know. For me, running is my security blanket in a way, because I’ve done it all my life. It’s what I know. Being a runner gives us one more thing we can do to try to get over a miscarriage. Running can give you a mental break and internal peace – it’s almost like you can run it away.”',1
'BROWN UNIVERSITY PLANS TO SPEND $100M TO IMPROVE RACE RELATIONS ON CAMPUS Brown University plans to spend $100m over the next decade, in order to address diversity and racism on the campus. Brown president Christina Paxson unveiled the 19-page draft action plan on Friday, and thanked students who have called attention in recent months to issues of injustice at the Ivy League school.  The Providence Journal reported that the plan outlined steps to create a “just and inclusive campus community”. That included ways to increase Brown’s racial and ethnic diversity and add race and ethnicity to teaching and research topics.  Earlier this month, about 35 graduate students representing several student organizations demanded Brown administrators increase efforts to improve race relations. Their statement came after a visiting Dartmouth College student was detained while attending a conference for Latino Ivy League students.  The issue of racial prejudice on university campuses has come to national attention in recent weeks.  At the University of Missouri student protests led to the resignations of president and chancellor; Princeton saw protests against programmes and buildings named for President Woodrow Wilson, over his segregationist views.  At Harvard Law School, portraits of six African American professors were vandalised with black tape.  On Wednesday, students nationwide participated in a day of protests under the social media banner “#StudentBlackOut”.  At the University of Kansas, meanwhile, a white professor was placed on paid leave after using a racial slur during a class discussion about race.  The school told Andrea Quenette, an assistant professor of communication studies, on Friday that five people had filed a discrimination complaint against her, she told the Lawrence Journal-World.  Students began complaining about Quenette after she used the racial slur during a 12 November class for graduate students who teach undergraduate classes. The class met the day after a contentious university-wide forum on race and discrimination moderated by Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little.    Quenette, 33, said diversity in the classroom was on the syllabus, and a student asked how they could talk about race issues in their own classes. The conversation then shifted to how the university should address racial problems.    She said she pointed out that racist incidents on other campuses, including the University of Missouri’s Columbia campus, have been very visible, and used the slur when comparing the University of Kansas to the other incidents. Quenette said she could have apologized “in the moment” if anyone had responded, but no one did, so she continued the discussion.  Amy Schumacher, a first-year doctoral student who was in the class of nine white students and one black student, said most “just shut down” after Quenette used the slur. Schumacher said she believes Quenette “actively violated policies” during the discussion, hurt students’ feelings — including the one black student, who left “devastated” — and has a previous history of being unsympathetic to students.  Quenette said she hopes to secure an attorney to represent her. She also said she believes academic freedom protects her comments and that they were not discriminatory.    “I didn’t intend to offend anyone,” she said. “I didn’t intend to hurt anyone. I didn’t direct my words at any individual or group of people.”',0
'LIVINGSOCIAL OFFERS A CAUTIONARY TALE TO TODAY’S UNICORNS Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  WASHINGTON — The first thing you see when walking into the headquarters of LivingSocial is row upon row of mostly empty desks, broken up by small street signs that employees once needed to find one another when the office teemed with people.          One row, “BYFAD Lane,” was named after a start-up, BuyYourFriendADrink, which LivingSocial acquired to get into the daily deals business. Other signs, such as “Sky Diving Street,” were named for some of the hottest discount coupons that the company once provided. On a recent visit, some desks were piled high with boxes of employee belongings, the detritus left behind after a round of layoffs that eliminated one-fifth of the work force. In one refrigerator, the milk was six months old.  The street signs are “anecdotes from our past,” said Mike Santore, who was director of content strategy at LivingSocial, referring to a time when it was nearly impossible to find a quiet desk to work. Now, he said, the signs “don’t mean anything, really.” Mr. Santore left the company this month.  Continue reading the main story Downward Spiral LivingSocial, an online marketplace offering daily discounts at local businesses, has consistently lost money in the last several years. LivingSocial in millions REVENUE $347 $302 $238 $231 ’11 ’12 ’13 ’14 in millions NET LOSS ’11 ’12 ’13 ’14 –$100 –$172 –$499 –$653  The technology industry’s boom over the last few years has been defined by the rise of “unicorns,” the private companies that investors have valued at $1 billion or more. Before the term came into vogue, LivingSocial was among the biggest unicorns of its day. It now offers a glimpse of what some of today’s unicorns might look like several years down the road if things go awry.  Just four years ago, LivingSocial and its larger rival Groupon grew rapidly on a simple pitch: The companies would match customers to local businesses with a daily deal in users’ inboxes, like half off at a local deli or a two-for-one massage promotion. LivingSocial and Groupon would take a cut of each transaction.  Venture capitalists anointed daily deals as the way that the Internet would invade local business, and by late 2011 LivingSocial had raised more than $800 million and reached a valuation of $4.5 billion, according to data from the research firm VC Experts. The company counted Amazon and the mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price among its investors. LivingSocial spent heavily, blanketing the airwaves with TV ad campaigns. Riding a wave of momentum, the company explored going public.  Today, LivingSocial is more unicorpse than unicorn. The company never filed for an initial public offering and consumer fervor for daily deals has cooled. T. Rowe Price has written down its stake in LivingSocial to nearly zero, data from Morningstar shows. The company’s work force has shrunk to around 800 employees from 4,500 at its peak in 2011. (Groupon, which did go public, is trading at more than 85 percent below its I.P.O. price.)  LivingSocial is now struggling to evolve its business by focusing on “new experiences,” such as a coupon-free program that puts cash back on customers’ credit cards when they dine at certain restaurants. The company is grappling with employee retention. It has also been selling nearly all of the foreign companies it bought and closing offices it opened during its boom days.

There are now 142 unicorns that are together valued at around $500 billion, according to the research firm CB Insights. Some of those highly valued start-ups are starting to show some cracks.  Snapchat, the messaging company, and Dropbox, the online storage business, were recently marked down in value by mutual fund investors. Zenefits, a human resources start-up, has said it missed sales targets and that it is slowing its hiring. On Wednesday, the payments company Square, which was valued at $6 billion by private investors last year, priced its public offering at $2.9 billion. Silicon Valley venture capitalists such as Bill Gurley of Benchmark and Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital have warned that a unicorn shakeout is coming.  Venky Ganesan is a venture capitalist in Menlo Ventures, which has invested in the ride-hailing company Uber and other unicorns. Just as LivingSocial’s valuation set expectations that were too high for the company to meet, he said, “today’s unicorns will face the same problems.”  LivingSocial was founded in 2007 by four friends, Aaron Batalion, Tim O’Shaughnessy, Eddie Frederick and Val Aleksenko, who had worked together at a health care start-up called Revolution Health Group. The first iteration of LivingSocial, called Hungry Machine, produced apps that hooked into Facebook, including polling apps and a way to share favorite books with friends. Over time, Hungry Machine became a company that sent customers daily emails with deals from businesses. Mr. O’Shaughnessy was the chief executive.  Consumers flocked to LivingSocial’s daily deals. About a year after getting into the business, the company said it had 10 million subscribers spread across the United States and Europe. A few months later, it said it had more than doubled its subscriber base. It pushed into Asia later that year. Its investors included Revolution Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Amazon and JPMorgan Chase; in total, LivingSocial has raised more than $919 million in capital.  Over the next several years, LivingSocial acquired consumers as fast as possible in an effort to build an unbreakable lead in daily deals. The company spent money on TV ads to create brand awareness. To increase expansion, LivingSocial scooped up start-ups in Spain, New Zealand and other markets that it knew little about. The company introduced deals in new categories such as travel and food delivery. There were hiring sprees.  Photo  But even as it spent big, the underlying business was not sound. Amazon’s recent financial filings show that in 2011, LivingSocial generated $238 million in revenue — but lost $499 million.  Groupon, which was also unprofitable, went public in November 2011 and promptly faced investor skepticism about its sustainability. The suspicions were contagious, infecting LivingSocial and halting its chances of going public. The start-up tried to raise $400 million in late 2011, but managed to secure only $176 million, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  LivingSocial’s investors now say it is easy to see that the growth-at-all-costs strategy created a downward spiral of overhiring and overexpansion. No one paid much attention to how the company would ultimately make money.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Our philosophy at that point was, ‘Customers are never going to be easier or cheaper to acquire as they are today’ and we, as a small company and board, said we have to step on the accelerator to build this out,” said Tige Savage, a LivingSocial board member and managing partner at Revolution Ventures. “We literally bet the company and went through 12 months of runway in a couple of months because we thought that the time to own the market was right.”  Mr. O’Shaughnessy, who was chief executive of LivingSocial until the beginning of 2014, did not respond to calls for comment. Only one of the four co-founders, Mr. Aleksenko, remains in a daily operating position.  LivingSocial is now run by a new chief, Gautam Thakar, who joined in August 2014 after a nearly decade at eBay. The company’s next act, Mr. Thakar said, will rely less on the deals and instead focus on a new cash-back initiative.  Photo  A pilot program, Restaurants Plus, gives customers cash-back discounts on their credit cards — no printed coupons required — when they dine at certain restaurants. LivingSocial takes a cut of each transaction.  “Our core audience is affluent, educated women — 25 to 40. What can we do to help this woman have a good weekend?” Mr. Thakar said. “Our job as a marketplace becomes helping merchants with data.”  Mr. Savage, the board member, put it more bluntly. “The fact of the matter is that vouchers are yesterday’s news,” he said.  There is other evidence that the daily deals fad is passing. Amazon recently shut down its own daily deals business. And Rich Williams, the new chief of Groupon, said in a blog post on Thursday that the company was “misunderstood” and that it was a myth that Groupon was an email daily deals company.  Internally at LivingSocial, employees have been skeptical about the strategy shift, according to three employees who left this year. About a dozen former employees and current investors said the company’s strategic missteps had taken a toll on morale. The discontent has been compounded by the inability of early employees — many of whom were lured with lucrative stock packages — to sell their LivingSocial shares.  As a result, retention is an issue, especially as LivingSocial competes with new unicorns for engineers. The company can no longer offer huge salaries and tantalizing stock packages to attract the top talent.  “It’s not the easiest thing in the world to hire tech people, wherever you are,” Mr. Thakar said. “We’re not Google-esque.”  LivingSocial has also been in belt-tightening mode, with a round of layoffs in October and divestitures of entire divisions. The company has shut offices in several cities, including New York and Seattle. Last fall, it sold Ticket Monster, based in South Korea. In February, the company sold LetsBonus, a Spain-based start-up it had acquired in 2011. Two months later, LivingSocial shed its Australia and New Zealand businesses, which Mr. Thakar characterized as “superfluous” to the company’s remaining operations in the United States and Canada.  “We’re focusing on our investments in technology, and focusing particularly in English-speaking countries,” Mr. Thakar said. “In many cases, people said they wished this had happened earlier.”  Investors, founders and many employees of LivingSocial are underwater with their shares, and an I.P.O. or sale seem very far off. When asked about this trajectory, Mr. Thakar said valuations were all “notional.” He added, “Valuations are one of those things that are in the eye of the beholder.”',0
'COMPETITIVENESS SEEN AS A VIRTUE, AT LEAST FOR MEN Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  NAPLES, Fla. — The two men, owners of thick collections of player photographs, stood behind the seventh green at Tiburon Golf Club, the site of this week’s L.P.G.A. Tour finale. The men had items for Suzann Pettersen of Norway to sign once she was finished on the green during Wednesday’s pro-am.          They insisted they were not autograph hunters procuring signatures for items to be placed for sale on the Internet. Besides, one of the men added, “There’s probably not much of a market after what she did.”  What did Pettersen, a major champion and 15-time tour winner, do to drive down the value of her autograph? Play with nonconforming equipment like Tom Brady and, after being caught, stubbornly maintain her innocence despite evidence to the contrary? Lose a season to a performance-enhancing drug suspension like Alex Rodriguez? Break an opponent’s leg like Chase Utley?  Pettersen’s crime was following the letter of the law in a tight four-ball match at the Solheim Cup in September in Germany. Pettersen, 34, was paired with Charley Hull against the American duo of Alison Lee and Brittany Lincicome in a contest that was all square through 16 holes. At the 17th, Lee missed a birdie putt to win the hole and picked up her ball, thinking the 18-inch par putt would be conceded to halve the hole.  Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.  But the putt had not been conceded, as Pettersen made plain to the match official, who awarded the hole to the European team. That set off a chain of events that led to the Americans losing the match but mounting a furious charge in the singles play to win the Cup.  By the end of the Americans’ comeback, the biggest loser was Pettersen, who was pilloried for allowing her competitiveness to get the better of her sportsmanship.  “She did not do the wrong thing,” Judy Rankin, a television commentator, said on the eve of the CME Group Tour Championship. “It just turns out not to have been the right thing.”  Rankin added, “It is pretty well assumed in the game of golf, and pretty much across the board, everyone wants to win and everybody wants to win fairly, but what you really want is to win when somebody else played good and not because of some other outside something.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Phil Mickelson’s competitiveness prompted him to publicly criticize his captain, Tom Watson, in the news conference after the United States’ loss in the 2014 Ryder Cup, a clear breach of golf etiquette. Far from being ostracized for his lapse in sportsmanship, he was empowered with a seat on a Ryder Cup task force that was formed afterward.  Then, at this year’s Presidents Cup, Mickelson switched balls midmatch, a rules infraction that resulted in his team essentially losing a hole twice. After the Americans rebounded to beat Adam Scott and Jason Day, Mickelson compounded his error when he chose talking trash over winning with grace.  “We spotted the Internationals’ best team two holes,” he said, “and they still couldn’t beat us. Just saying.”  Pettersen’s competitiveness resulted in her being instantly upbraided on the Internet by critics who included other European female golfers and a smattering of PGA Tour players. The day after the event, Pettersen apologized.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “I put the point that could be earned ahead of sportsmanship and the game of golf itself,” she said, adding, “I can be so much better, and being an ambassador of the game means a lot to me.”  Before her first competitive round on American soil since the Solheim Cup, Pettersen revisited the fateful four-ball match, particularly the scene at 18th hole, where Hull and Lee dissolved in tears and Pettersen ignored the pleas of her captain, Carin Koch, to concede the 18th hole to halve the match.  “I just think the way the situation was handled could have been done differently,” Pettersen said. “How it all went down on 18 after the match was not a pretty sight for TV, and I guess we all could have taken more responsibility and left that out of the picture.”  To be a female athlete is to be ever mindful that appearances matter. Prettiness is next to godliness, which is why many of the players wear makeup during tournaments and treat their competitiveness as an imperfection that needs to be covered up with hugs and smiles. The same icy stare that identifies Tiger Woods as a fierce competitor is off-putting when it freezes Pettersen’s opponents.  “Absolutely, there is a double standard,” said Pettersen’s swing instructor, Butch Harmon, whose past clients include Mickelson and Woods. “It’s not right. One of the things I love about Suzann is what a great competitor she is. She prepares, and she plays, to win.”  Speaking by telephone, Harmon added: “If you look at Serena Williams, she gets put in the same category. People say Serena Williams is overaggressive. No, what she is is very, very good and very, very competitive.”  Rankin recalled that Pettersen had once been voted the most intimidating player in an anonymous poll of her peers.  “And when she heard it,” Rankin said, “she said, ‘Good.’ ”  Pettersen has scorched enough people with her intensity that L.P.G.A. officials, well before the Solheim Cup, had made a push to polish her competitive edges as if she were the tour’s Eliza Doolittle.  On Thursday, Pettersen was greeted with polite applause by the roughly four dozen fans around the first tee. She finished with a humdrum one-under 71, five shots behind the leader, Austin Ernst. Pettersen said she had moved on from what happened in the team event, but Jerry Foltz, working the event for Golf Channel, wondered how that was possible.  “I feel sorry for her,” he said, “because something like this, it’s not going to define her career, but it will follow her for a long, long time.”  What about Lee, whose rookie mistake became Pettersen’s misery?  “Literally, it hasn’t even been on my mind,” Lee said after signing for a 69.  She added: “I don’t think I would have done anything differently. For me, it’s not that I feel bad for what I did. I just feel bad that everyone kind of pointed the finger at Suzann.”  Before the tournament, members of the L.P.G.A.’s extended family were invited to a screening of “The Founders,” a feature-length documentary about the 13 women who formed the L.P.G.A. in 1950. Speaking to the camera, one of the founders, Louise Suggs, said she had a hard time being friendly on the course. The film makes clear that her main rival, Babe Zaharias, was never confused for the head of the welcome wagon committee.  One of the three living founders, Marilynn Smith, said before the screening that she had watched the Solheim Cup on television. She was rooting for the United States, but she could not take the Americans’ side on the controversy that engulfed the event.  “I thought she did the right thing,” Smith said, referring to Pettersen. “I don’t understand why people criticized her. I gave her a big hug today. She’s one of my favorite people.”',1
'TRUMP, UNDER FIRE, BACKS OFF MUSLIM DATABASE IDEA Donald Trump backed off discussion of a mandatory database to track Muslims on Friday after a torrent of criticism from both Republicans and Democratic opponents.  “I didn’t suggest a database — a reporter did,” Trump tweeted. “We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America.”  I didn\'t suggest a database-a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015  Trump, who has talked about warrantless searches and possibly closing mosques in the wake of the Paris attacks, told NBC News on Thursday when asked about a database: “I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.”  That comment drew immediate fire from Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who tweeted Friday: “This is shocking rhetoric.

It should be denounced by all seeking to lead this country. -H https://t.co/qs2TJI5spu — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 20, 2015  Republican opponent Jeb Bush told CNBC: “There are no Christian terrorists wandering around the world trying to take out peace-loving Muslims — this is a serious problem … (But) it does not mean we should be disrespectful of Muslims in our country or anything like that. In fact, I find it abhorrent that Donald Trump is suggesting that we register people.”  Ted Cruz also jumped into the fray, tell reporters in Iowa: “I’m a big fan of Donald Trump’s but I’m not a fan of government registries of American citizens. The First Amendment protects religious liberty, I’ve spent the past several decades defending religious liberty.”  Bernie Sanders, who is opposing Clinton in the Democratic primaries, called Trump’s statements “outrageous and bigoted” and said the New York businessman should be ashamed of himself.  “We will not destroy ISIS (the Islamic State) by undermining the Constitution and our religious freedoms,” Sanders said.  The exchanges reflect the escalating American political rhetoric a week after the attacks in Paris.  In an interview with Yahoo News earlier this week, Trump said: “We’re going to have to — we’re going to have to look at a lot of things very closely.”',0
'MILITARY REPORTS SLIGHT UPTICK IN WOMEN JOINING OFFICER CORPS The Air Force Academy Class of 2015 takes the oath of office in Colorado Springs, Colo. in May. A new report says the services have seen a slight increase in the number of women becoming officers (Photo: Michael Kaplan, United States Air Force)  The Pentagon is seeing a small rise in the percentage of women entering the officer corps, according to a report released last week.  The percentage of women among incoming officers was 22.7% in 2014, up from 21.7% in 2010, the Government Accountability Office found.  Female retention is a concern among top Pentagon officials who say women typically leave the service at higher rates than men.  Military leaders are pushing policies designed to appeal to mid-career women and improve retention. For example, the Navy and Marine Corps recently expanded maternity leave to 18 weeks, and the Air Force recently adopted a rule assuring new mothers they will not have to deploy for one year after having a child.  All four service branches have recruitment efforts that target women, the GAO noted in its Friday report.  Congress ordered the GAO to examine the rate of women entering the military and the individual services\' recruitment and outreach efforts for women.  In the military population at large, the percentage of women in the officer corps is rising more slowly. Women make up about 17% of military officers of all ranks, up from 15.3% in 2005, according to Defense Department data.  The four military services vary significantly in their demographics and the shifts seen during the past several years.  The Marine Corps reported the largest increase in women entering the officer corps; in 2014, that figure was 11.8%, up from 7.6% in 2010.  For the Army, the percentage of women entering the officer corps rose to 21.4%, up slightly from 20.6% four years earlier.  For the Navy, the percentage of women ticked up marginally to 22.7%, from 22.5% in 2010.  The Air Force\'s figure rose to 27.4% in 2014, up from 27% in 2010.',1
'U.S. FALLS TO 28TH ON GLOBAL GENDER EQUALITY LIST Vigdis Finnbogadottir, former president of Iceland attends an international conference 22 October 2015 in Reykjavik, Iceland, marking the culmination of year-long celebration of the centenary of women\'s suffrage in Iceland and Denmark. Iceland ranked the highest in a recent World Economic Forum report on gender equality. (Photo: EPA/ANTON BRINK)  SAN FRANCISCO—The United States fell to 28th place on a yearly list of the world\'s most and least equal countries for men and women, behind countries including Iceland, Rwanda and Germany.  America fell out of the top 20 on this year\'s World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap report, eight places down from last year. Its overall score was .74, with 1.00 being total equality between men and women and 0 being total inequality.  The drop is mostly due to U.S. wage similarity for similar jobs dropping and fewer women in high government positions.  The most equal country in the world for women was Iceland, the report found. It\'s been in the top slot for seven years in a row. Its score was .88.  Norway, Finland, Sweden and Ireland finished out the top five list. Rwanda was sixth and Philippines, 7.  The least equal country in the world for women, ranking 145th, was Yemen. In that Middle Eastern nation, only 55% of women can read and only 6% attend college. There are no women in the Yemeni equivalent of Congress.  The U.S. numbers aren\'t surprising, said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the non-partisan Pew Research Center in Washington D.C.  "We have not been at the leading edge internationally of female representation in top leadership positions nor in gender pay equity," she said.  The report, which looks at data from 145 countries, put the United States 74th in terms of equal pay for equal work.  Research shows that\'s most affected by occupational segregation, with women filling more lower-wage administrative jobs than the mean, and the fact that women work fewer hours than men overall, said Parker.  Implicit bias  Overt discrimination against women is less of an issue than in the past, but more implicit bias still hampers women in the workplace, said Catherine Hill, director of research for the American Association of University Women, which has studied women in the workplace.  She cited a paper that found when the exact same resume was sent to university faculty, the person listed as John was more likely to be hired, offered a bigger salary and more likely to be mentored than the one listed as Jennifer.  The professors making the judgements "are smart people who don’t see themselves as biased but in truth, implicit bias is creeping into their decisions," Hill said.  Caring for children is another area where the U.S. lags.  Nations that offer government-supported child care and generous time off to care for family, such as the Nordic countries, see less economic damage to women\'s overall earning power due to having children.  "Our survey data shows very clearly that women are much more likely than men to experience major career interruptions related to family caregiving. And working mothers are much more likely than working fathers to say that being a working parent has made it harder for them to get ahead in their job or career," said Parker of the Pew Research Center.  This is shifting, she said. "Gender roles are definitely changing, as men are taking on more responsibilities at home in terms of child care and housework. So we will have to keep watching these trends."  College educated  A bright spot was education and women\'s health. Women in the United States are overall more likely to complete high school and college than men. They also live longer, 71 years as compared to 68.  For political power, the United States ranked 81st in terms of the number of women in high government positions.  In general, "the United States does appear to be losing some ground," said Hill, and that hurts women.  "We\'re a wonderful democracy that provides great opportunities," she said. "Yet we don\'t have the family leave or child care support that other countries have."',1
'THE SURPRISING THING YOU NEVER NOTICED ABOUT APPLE Head over to the account @Apple on the social media site, and you\'ll be greeted by this page:  Apple, one of the most recognizable names in Silicon Valley, has a curious relationship with Twitter.  The account, created in September 2011, has amassed over 36,000 followers -- but it\'s never been updated. There are no tweets, and the profile picture remains Twitter\'s default white egg avatar. Not exactly what you\'d expect from the world\'s most profitable company.  To be completely honest, we can\'t confirm that the account @Apple indeed belongs to the Cupertino-based powerhouse. Apple did not respond to a request for comment, so, for all we know, the account may have been created by an early Twitter user who decided to abandon the social network without ever posting.  However, a more probable explanation is that Apple\'s digital silence on Twitter is absolutely intentional. In other words, Apple made a conscious decision not to have an active brand account under the handle @Apple.  After all, the tech giant maintains a handful of verified Twitter accounts for various divisions within the company, including @AppleMusic, @iTunesTrailers and @iBooks. The company\'s CEO, Tim Cook, regularly uses Twitter to communicate with his 1.71 million followers.  "Tim Cook is on Twitter, and that is good enough for now," Belus Capital analyst Brian Sozzi told CNBC last year. "Apple has nothing to gain by creating an account."  Sozzi explained that a company like Apple -- which notoriously keeps its products at a premium price point -- has very little to gain from aggressive social media marketing.  "Apple isn\'t going to be like Starbucks and run promoted tweets offering dollars off a product for a limited time," Sozzi said. "Apple is a premium experience all around, you go to Apple, they do not go to you."  The same social media strategy can also be found in other parts of Apple\'s digital presence. Apple lacks an official page on Facebook, though it has pages for individual services like Apple Music and the AppStore. Similarly, the company\'s official YouTube account doesn\'t allow visitors to post comments.  We also reached out to @Apple directly, but the inquiry went unanswered. So it seems that the account owner -- whether it\'s the real Apple or not -- doesn\'t mind keeping up the mystery.',0
'TURN OFF YOUR DEVICES? SOMETIMES PLAYS TURN THEM ON Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Here’s a recipe for a terrible play: Characters are rarely in the same room as one another; conversations are typed rather than spoken; one side of a dispute can’t be heard by the audience.          Not great drama but, in 2015 America, the stuff of real life, where the rapid spread of mobile technology has redefined the way people talk, the way they shop, the way they walk down the street.  As a result, it is redefining how they interact onstage and, in the process, challenging playwrights, directors and set designers who are trying to figure out matters as technical as how to let theater audiences know what is being said on screens they cannot see, and as cosmic as what technological change means for human interconnectedness.  “My most important and consequential arguments and fights and interactions happen on my phone every day,” said the playwright Kevin Armento, whose recent Off Broadway work, “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,” told the story of a sexual relationship between a high school math teacher and her student entirely from the point of view of the boy’s smartphone.  Photo  “How would you even tell this story if it weren’t through their text messages?” Mr. Armento asked. “It wouldn’t be believable in 2015.”  Even as some playwrights embrace the integration of digital communication into stage scenes as a new form of naturalism, other theater people worry that their art form will be affected by communication that values brevity over elegance and, increasingly, images over words.  “Technology is creating a culture that devalues language — our need for a sentence is less,” said Sam Gold, who won a Tony Award this spring for directing the musical “Fun Home.” “That really affects theater, because theater is an oral medium. It’s communicated through words.”  While he avoids social media in his life, Mr. Gold has incorporated digital communication onstage: This summer he directed “John,” the new work from the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Annie Baker, in which one character’s receipt of texts (which were never shared with the audience, but were signaled by the familiar iPhone tritone alert) was a significant plot element.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Theaters, of course, spend a lot of time warning audience members to shut off their cellphones, sometimes to no avail. But onstage, mobile communication has become so integral to contemporary theater that a Tony-winning sound designer, Robert Kaplowitz, collaborated with a programmer, Jay Konopka, to design an app that makes iPhones ring or beep, or both, on cue. Next: figuring out how to make phones light up on cue, so that they cast a lifelike glow on actors.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Playwrights have been exploring the perils of the Internet for years: “The Dying Gaul,” which ran Off Broadway in 1998, featured the use of a chat room for deception, as did “Closer,” which ran on Broadway in 1999.  And even before the advent of digital communication, theater makers wanted to incorporate the latest conversational technology into their work. Think of “Bells Are Ringing,” a popular 1956 musical about a woman who works at a telephone answering service, or “Bye Bye Birdie,” the Tony-winning best musical of 1961, which features a much-loved show tune, “The Telephone Hour,” in which land lines are vehicles for teenage gossip.  Many of today’s playwrights are raising explicit questions about new forms of communication. “The Nether,” a play by Jennifer Haley that has been produced over the last two years in Los Angeles, London and New York, depicts a world in which men are prosecuted for sex crimes committed by their online avatars. “Privacy,” a play by James Graham that ran in London last year, details the threats posed by government surveillance.  Some shows, acknowledging that theatergoers cannot let go of their own phones, are seeking to employ them in storytelling. At “Elements of Oz,” presented by the Builders Association at Montclair State University in New Jersey this fall, theatergoers downloaded an app that supplemented the onstage production. At the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Miranda July had audience members use pictures on their phones (then projected on a screen) for her performance piece “New Society.” And this summer’s Broadway run by Penn & Teller used the cellphones of audience members for an opening trick.  But the most striking new development is the normalization of onstage digital communication: the number of shows in which mobile devices and social media are not the subject of comment or criticism, but simply a contemporary reality.  Photo  “The phone is totally boring its way into the consciousness of playwrights, because we live with them stapled to our faces, and major emotional and life-altering information is being transmitted via these devices,” said Bray Poor, a sound designer who worked on Ms. Baker’s “John.”  “Especially when you’re dealing with younger playwrights — phones were part of their college lives, they are part of their romantic lives,” Mr. Poor said. “The phone is elemental, and so it will be in their plays.”  The examples are everywhere. Quiara Alegría Hudes’s 2012 Pulitzer Prize-winning “Water by the Spoonful” was set partly in an online chat room for drug addicts, requiring characters to speak words they actually would have typed. Now she is working on a new musical, “Miss You Like Hell,” in which the commenters on a teenage girl’s online diary form the show’s ensemble.

And “Dear Evan Hansen,” coming to Second Stage Theater Off Broadway in the spring after a run at Arena Stage in Washington, uses projections from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Gmail to evoke the cacophonous swirl of social media in a high school grappling with a teenager’s suicide.  “We didn’t set out to write a show about social media — in fact, it’s been our sense that when we see technology in theater, a lot of times it feels inauthentic to us,” said Benj Pasek, who wrote the “Hansen” show’s book and lyrics with Justin Paul. “But we wanted to layer it in, because it’s part of our everyday lives.”  The challenge of dramatizing digital communication exists in film, television and books as well, but is especially pronounced on the stage, where printed language (in projections or supertitles) is often viewed as less compelling than the spoken word.  Such technology is “appearing in a lot of plays already, but we as an industry still need to figure out how to make it truly theatrical,” said Paige Evans, the artistic director of LCT3, Lincoln Center Theater’s program for new playwrights, directors and designers.  Some writers have tried to dodge the issue. Jonathan Marc Sherman moved a play he is now writing, called “The Squeaky Wheel,” from 2008 to 2000 so his characters could read real estate listings in a newspaper instead of on an app. Laura Eason used a snowstorm in the first act of “Sex With Strangers,” which was produced last year at Second Stage, to disrupt wireless reception in a Michigan bed-and-breakfast so her characters would not be able to Google one another.  And even in “The Humans,” Mr. Karam set the action in a ground-floor/basement duplex with poor reception so that the bulk of the play could take place without digital interruptions.  “I was definitely interested in how, in a world in which we are so married to these forms of communication, do we behave when we’re shut off,” he said.',0
'A STREET-LEVEL SEARCH FOR WOMEN TO PUT ON A MANHATTAN PEDESTAL Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Joan of Arc’s armor glistened in the noonday sun as she walked slowly through the lunchtime crowds rushing past the Flatiron Building in Manhattan recently. Every now and then, she paused and scanned the sidewalk, slightly tilting her head back as she announced her mission.          “Where are the women?” she cried with a touch of drama in her voice. “I’ve just stepped off my pedestal on 93rd Street! Where are the women?”  She approached Joshua Randle, a traffic agent. “There are only five monuments to women in New York City,” she said to him. “Would you like to nominate a woman?”  Well, since she put it that way, Mr. Randle did.  “Oprah,” he said. “She’s done a lot for the community. She opened schools. Kids need role models.”  Grown-ups need them too, Joan of Arc might say. At least that’s what the woman beneath the armor, Lois Evans, a playwright and performance artist known as LuLu LoLo, believes.  Ms. Evans has been popping up around New York recently, asking people to nominate women who they think should be memorialized with a public monument. Over the last few weeks, people have suggested everyone from Bella S. Abzug and Dorothy Day to Fannie Lou Hamer and Patti LaBelle. More than a few of those she asked singled out — no surprise — their own mothers.  “I don’t try to set limits on them,” Ms. Evans said. “I’m curious about who people think are important and who inspires them. All of my work has been about history, New York City and women.”  Memory and honor, too. Ms. Evans got the idea for this particular performance in 2011, during events commemorating the centennial of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire in Greenwich Village. Of the 146 people who died in the fire, Ms. Evans had focused her energy on the 10 from East Harlem, where she was raised. During discussions about a possible monument related to the fire — she also belongs to a group that wants to put a memorial at the place where it happened — she began to think about how women had, or had not, been portrayed in monuments.  She said Manhattan had only five public monuments of women: statues of Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt, Golda Meir, Gertrude Stein and Joan of Arc (at Riverside Park and 93rd Street). There is also a fountain in Bryant Park dedicated to Josephine Shaw Lowell, an early consumer advocate. Statues of Mother Goose and Alice in Wonderland in Central Park do not count, which is why Ms. Evans supports a campaign to erect a statue there that honors the pioneering feminists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  “There are many memorials that depict woman allegorically, representing beauty or sacrifice,” Ms. Evans said. “Most of the models for those were Audrey Munson, who was beautiful, in the movies even, but wound up in an insane asylum. She was the model for so many. She’s the Spirit of Commerce on the Manhattan Bridge.”  The decision to have Joan of Arc step off her pedestal came a few months ago, when Ms. Evans was asked to participate in this year’s edition of the public art project Art in Odd Places. In previous years, she had performed in Union Square as a newsboy and an elegantly hatted gentleman. This year, with sword and shield — emblazoned with “Where Are the Women?” — she took to the streets. She needed the patience of, well, a saint when she tried to approach people rushing past.

But now, trying to get somebody to stop is difficult.”  Ms. Evans does have fans who follow her, like Andi Sosin, who has worked with her to raise money for the Triangle memorial. Ms. Sosin and her husband, Joel Sosinsky, sought Ms. Evans out at her Flatiron performance.  “She is just an amazing street artist,” Ms. Sosin said. “She really has figured out so many ways to involve New Yorkers in the life and history of our city.”  Eric Zimmerman, a construction worker, slowed down as Ms. Evans came toward him with her practiced pitch to nominate a woman for a monument. Maybe Mr. Zimmerman, with his hard hat, could relate to Joan of Arc, with her helmet. Soon he was nominating Bessie Coleman, the first African-American to be licensed as a civilian pilot. Ms. Coleman turned to barnstorming when discrimination prevented her from flying planes commercially. Mr. Zimmerman said he had heard that the Postal Service was among those who refused to hire her.  “My mother and sister work for the Postal Service,” Mr. Zimmerman said. “I wanted to honor their work.”  With a flourish, Ms. Evans turned toward him. “Mr. Zimmerman,” she said, “I dub thee a Follower of Women.”',1
