'Puerto Rico Puerto Rico will not make $370m payment as debt crisis continues Governor Alejandro Garcia Padill says island can’t pay debts due without cutting essential services, after failed attempt to negotiate a settlement Puerto Rico has been suffering through more than a decade of economic decline since US phased out tax cuts that had made island a center for pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturing. Photograph: Ricardo Arduengo/AP Associated Press in San Juan Monday 2 May 2016 07.59 EDT Share on WhatsApp Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla announced that Puerto Rico’s government will not make nearly $370m in bond payments due Monday after a failure to restructure or find a political solution to the US territory’s spiralling public debt crisis . Garcia said Sunday that he had issued an executive order suspending payments on debt owed by the island’s Government Development Bank, a default that will likely prompt lawsuits from creditors and could be a prelude to a deadline to a much larger payment due 1 July. The governor said Puerto Rico can’t pay the bonds without cutting essential services. Related: Puerto Rico woos US investors with huge tax breaks as locals fund debt crisis Island officials spent the weekend trying to negotiate a settlement that would have avoided the default but apparently came up short. The development comes as Congress has so far been unable to pass a debt restructuring bill for Puerto Rico. “Let me be very clear, this was a painful decision,” Garcia said in a speech. “We would have preferred to have had a legal framework to restructure our debts in an orderly manner.” The Government Development Bank had $422m in payments due Monday. Puerto Rico will pay $22m interest and it reached a deal Friday to restructure about $30m, leaving it short $370m. The administration also will be paying about $50m in other debt payments due Monday owed by various other territorial agencies. Nearly all the bonds are held by a variety of US hedge funds and mutual funds. Garcia said Puerto Rico’s government could not make the payment without sacrificing basic necessities for the island’s 3.5 million residents, including keeping schools and public hospitals open. “We will continue working to try to reach a consensual solution with our creditors,” he said. “That is one of our commitments. But what we will never do is put the lives and safety of our people in danger.” The governor had been warning since last year that the island’s overall public debt of more than $70bn is unpayable. Puerto Rico has been suffering through more than a decade of economic decline since Congress phased out tax cuts that had made the island a center for pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturing. Garcia’s predecessors and the island legislature borrowed heavily to cover over budget deficits, causing a debt spiral that has already prompted several smaller defaults. Related: Puerto Rico’s ’unpayable’ debt: is this the Greece of the western hemisphere? Creditors have accused the government of exaggerating the crisis to avoid upcoming payments of more than $1bn due 1 July that includes general obligation bonds, which are guaranteed by the constitution. Economists have warned that a default of this magnitude could cause Puerto Rico to lose access to capital markets and make the situation worse as the government faces the much larger payment due 1 July. Garcia lashed out at Congress for failing to pass a bill that would create a control board to help manage the island’s $70bn debt and to oversee some debt restructuring. He said it has been held up by “internal partisan and ideological divisions” in the House of Representatives. “We can’t wait longer,” he said. “We need this restructuring mechanism now.” ',?
'Hulu Hulu to add live TV offering to compete with Netflix and cable providers Multiple reports citing executives at the internet video streaming service published Monday confirmed the additions to the streaming service Hulu’s 11.22.63, adapted from the Stephen King bestseller. Photograph: Publicity image Monday 2 May 2016 12.11 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 12.20 EDT Share on WhatsApp Hulu , the internet video streaming service, is planning to take on the traditional cable and broadcast networks with a live TV offering. The service will expand beyond Hulu’s broadcasts of recent reruns of broadcast and cable shows and make it a direct competitor of traditional pay-TV providers and new digital entrants, including Netflix. Related: TV networks battle new media threat as Facebook looms over ad war Multiple reports citing Hulu executives published Monday confirmed the additions to the streaming service, which is owned by a consortium of competing television production companies including NBCUniversal, Disney and Fox Broadcasting. When they debut in the first quarter of 2017, both the format of the new networks and the ads delivered through them would be tailored to the user, an executive told the New York Times . Cable companies and TV providers have made efforts in the recent past to escape from the old-fashioned channel-surfing model associated with cable TV and appeal more broadly to the youth market, which has refused to adopt costly cable subscriptions. Related: 11.22.63 review – sumptuous Stephen King adaptation bodes well for Hulu Executives told the Wall Street Journal that Fox and Disney were closest to deals to bring networks in their respective stables to the service. Like its streaming video competitors, Hulu has invested heavily over the last three years after the ouster of founding CEO Jason Kilar – under new CEO Mike Hopkins, the company has commissioned programs including an expensive adaptation of Stephen King bestseller 11/22/63 , from JJ Abrams, and an upcoming miniseries version of Margaret Atwood’s novel The Handmaid’s Tale . But Hulu has also bucked conventional understandings of the way it would compete in the market against Netflix and Amazon Prime, where it was initially seen as an ad-filled version of popular ad-free streaming services that simply got content earlier. Instead, Hulu launched its own ad-free tier at a higher premium and agreed not to trim cinephile prints of classic films from boutique movie distributor the Criterion Collection to fit ad breaks. Now, Hulu is flirting with a model tested by services including PlayStation Vue and Sling TV: traditional ad-supported television networks streaming alongside its proprietary shows and the back catalog of television offered on demand.

'Share on WhatsApp What proportion of British board members are women? The figures are disappointing (26.1% at FTSE 100 companies and 19.6% at FTSE 250 firms), which is why a target has been set for FTSE 100 firms to have 33% female board members by 2020 . But what’s it like for those who have made it in already? We hear confessions from women both in the public and private sector. ‘People commented on my looks, not my capabilities’ I was the only woman of 13 men on the board of a large IT services company, and was on the receiving end of a lot of sexist bias – some conscious but a lot of it unconscious. For example, I experienced inappropriate comments and unsolicited advances from my mainly married peers at board level. Women at all levels experience this, however. Related: A third of boardroom positions should be held by women, UK firms told I was quite young when I joined this board – 33 – and many also felt that it was OK to comment on my looks rather than my capabilities. This led me to changing my image to discourage any attention: I wore no makeup and screwed my hair back. I got the position through hard work and building up a good reputation (I had been referred to the chief executive by a senior woman in my previous company) so my looks should never have come into it. I am not sure men are aware that mentioning how women look makes many of us feel uncomfortable. I really think that they must believe we feel complimented in some way. But instead it makes a lot of women believe that they don’t want to be in that boys’ club and so they are turned off from applying for those positions; they may think that they simply don’t belong in that environment, or are intimidated by it. Despite this, it has been my privilege to be the only woman, the group marketing director, on the board of a $1bn company, told by several female employees that they saw me as a role model. That was what really made it for me; that I might have inspired at least one other woman to try. One of the big issues, certainly in the technology sector, is the unconscious bias of a profile of white male executives in their 50s doing the hiring to boards. For example just today, one of the women that I coach in a large tech company said: “All the managers here are white, middle-aged men. When a woman leaves, she is replaced by a man.” Whether this is true or not, that is her perception. This is a young, university-educated 20-something who is looking desperately for role models. So the key challenge is: who is there for her to look up to, and whose footsteps does she follow in? Former female board member of large UK firm, 39 ‘The UK is much better than elsewhere in the world’ On the face of it, you would expect the board I sit on (of a public/private initiative in the north), to be horribly sexist. Its shareholders include a council, a university and a telecommunications services company. However, I have never felt that any dialogue, debate or attitude has been influenced by my gender. I have seen an old boys’ culture in the private sector where men on boards go to things such as rugby, excluding women In fact, I have experienced less sexism while sitting on boards than I have when pitching for or delivering work. I have also sat on boards abroad, and have seen horrendous sexism and racism elsewhere in the world. I’m actually very proud of the UK and our inclusive society. While the situation is improving, however, I believe quotas would be a mistake. Women want to feel that they have got something because of their own merit, and being seen as a “quota hire” will undoubtedly, at some point, incentivise a discriminatory comment, such as: “You’re only here because we had to have a woman.” In order to be taken seriously we, as women, cannot be seen as the victim or a group that needs special attention – we have to prove our worth and stand on our own two feet. Any purposeful and harmful discrimination needs to be dealt with professionally, within the boundaries of the law and governance. A consultant specialising in technology startups, 47 ‘Women need to have more role models’ My board roles are in the public/third sector and on both boards there is a high percentage of women. As a result, perhaps, I have not been aware of any overt discrimination or sexism. I suspect that private sector experiences would be very different. However, I am sure that there is a level of unconscious sexism, and I have no way of knowing if I failed to get other roles because of my gender. Interestingly, I experienced active discrimination at a previous role where women’s efforts to progress to board level were actively blocked, and men’s encouraged. Related: Five things to promote gender equality at work There are definitely more challenges for women trying to get on a board, including a lack of effective role models throughout the career process. I meet many women who have never thought that a board position could be a possibility, so have not thought about how to structure their career to attain it. (Women also seem to be worse at career planning than men.) We also face bias – conscious or unconscious – in staff development and recruitment. There’s a well-known factor that groups will recruit new group members that they feel comfortable with. This generally means “people like them”. So a predominantly white male board will usually prefer white male candidates. Plus, recruitment methods are often unconsciously biased by the experience of the recruiter. When I started my career, women were steered towards softer subjects and softer careers, which typically are not represented at board level. Now my cohort and I are reaching the level of seniority to consider board positions, those career choices may hinder advancement to the next level because there isn’t the perceived need for those softer skills at board level. So the pool of suitable candidates has far more men than women. Technology director at a public sector organisation, 51 ‘There’s a real old boys’ network in the private sector’ The disparity between how women are treated in the public and private sector is massive. I have worked in a FTSE 100 company and also for a public sector organisation in an education role. The private sector follows a law unto itself and women are seen much less on board and senior executive roles. However, moving into the public sector it’s been much more diverse. That’s particularly relevant to the sector I work in. In the business sector for women who don’t have kids maybe there is less of a difference but the moment you have a child everything changes. At the FTSE company meetings were always held in the evenings, making it hard if you had a caring responsibility. I now work in a senior role in the education sector and it’s my responsibility to recruit board members. As a mother with three children I am careful to make sure that my meetings are flexible, looking at the best time to try to be family-friendly. I have also seen an old boys’ network culture in the private sector where men on boards go to things such as the rugby, or out drinking, excluding women – even if you’re working at the same level. I cannot say I’ve experienced any overt discrimination myself, but I think there is a real reluctance for the private sector to embrace gender diversity in the same way as the public sector. We’ve seen improvements on boards in the public sector – for example, in education, the NHS and police – but the private business world is very slow on the uptake. Governance role, 45 ',?
'TTIP Leaked TTIP documents cast doubt on EU-US trade deal Greenpeace says internal documents show US attempts to lower or circumvent EU protection for environment and public health Protesters wear masks of Barack Obama and Angela Merkel as they demonstrate against TTIP free trade agreement. Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters Sunday 1 May 2016 13.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 1 May 2016 17.00 EDT Share on WhatsApp Talks for a free trade deal between Europe and the US face a serious impasse with “irreconcilable” differences in some areas, according to leaked negotiating texts. The two sides are also at odds over US demands that would require the EU to break promises it has made on environmental protection. President Obama said last week he was confident a deal could be reached. But the leaked negotiating drafts and internal positions, which were obtained by Greenpeace and seen by the Guardian, paint a very different picture. Related: TTIP is a very bad excuse to vote for Brexit | Nick Dearden “Discussions on cosmetics remain very difficult and the scope of common objectives fairly limited,” says one internal note by EU trade negotiators. Because of a European ban on animal testing, “the EU and US approaches remain irreconcilable and EU market access problems will therefore remain,” the note says. Talks on engineering were also “characterised by continuous reluctance on the part of the US to engage in this sector,” the confidential briefing says. These problems are not mentioned in a separate report on the state of the talks, also leaked, which the European commission has prepared for scrutiny by the European parliament. These outline the positions exchanged between EU and US negotiators between the 12th and the 13th round of TTIP talks , which took place in New York last week. The public document offers a robust defence of the EU’s right to regulate and create a court-like system for disputes, unlike the internal note, which does not mention them. Jorgo Riss, the director of Greenpeace EU, said: “These leaked documents give us an unparalleled look at the scope of US demands to lower or circumvent EU protections for environment and public health as part of TTIP. The EU position is very bad, and the US position is terrible. The prospect of a TTIP compromising within that range is an awful one. The way is being cleared for a race to the bottom in environmental, consumer protection and public health standards.” US proposals include an obligation on the EU to inform its industries of any planned regulations in advance, and to allow them the same input into EU regulatory processes as European firms. American firms could influence the content of EU laws at several points along the regulatory line, including through a plethora of proposed technical working groups and committees. “Before the EU could even pass a regulation, it would have to go through a gruelling impact assessment process in which the bloc would have to show interested US parties that no voluntary measures, or less exacting regulatory ones, were possible,” Riss said. The US is also proposing new articles on “science and risk” to give firms greater regulatory say. Disputes over pesticides residues and food safety would be dealt with by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Codex Alimentarius system. Environmentalists say the body has loose rules on corporate influence, allowing employees of companies such as BASF, Nestle and Coca Cola to sit on – and sometimes lead – national delegations. Some 44% of its decisions on pesticides residues have been less stringent than EU ones, with 40% of rough equivalence and 16% being more demanding, according to Greenpeace. GM foods could also find a widening window into Europe, with the US pushing for a working group to adopt a “low level presence initiative”. This would allow the import of cargo containing traces of unauthorised GM strains. The EU currently blocks these because of food safety and cross-pollination concerns. Related: What is TTIP and why should we be angry about it? The EU has not yet accepted the US demands, but they are uncontested in the negotiators’ note, and no counter-proposals have been made in these areas. In January, the EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström said [pdf] the precautionary principle, obliging regulatory caution where there is scientific doubt, was a core and non-negotiable EU principle. She said: “We will defend the precautionary approach to regulation in Europe, in TTIP and in all our other agreements.” But the principle is not mentioned in the 248 pages of TTIP negotiating texts. The European commission has also promised to safeguard environmental laws, defend international standards and protect the EU’s right to set high green benchmarks in future. But the new leak will not placate critics of the deal , who have pointed to attempts by fossil fuel firms and others to influence its outcome, as a sign of things to come. The EU negotiators internal note says “the US expressed that it would have to consult with its chemical industry on how to position itself” on issues of market access for non-agricultural goods. Where industry lobbying in regulatory processes is concerned, the US also “insisted” that the EU be “required” to involve US experts in its development of electrotechnical standards. ',?

'California Sexual harassment training may have reverse effect, research suggests Trainings’ use of ‘cartoonish, unrealistic’ examples could be partially to blame for men’s subsequent dismissal of allegations, says Berkeley professor ‘People in powerful positions don’t have a good grasp of what it’s like to be in a non-dominant group’ Photograph: Rex/Shuttershock Monday 2 May 2016 13.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 13.03 EDT Share on WhatsApp Sexual harassment courses aimed at preventing workplace discrimination can have the opposite effect, making men less capable of perceiving inappropriate behavior and more likely to blame victims, according to academic studies that cast doubt on traditional training programs. One researcher who has questioned the effectiveness of harassment prevention classes is Lauren Edelman, a professor of law and sociology at the University of California Berkeley, the prestigious school that has been at the center of a series of high-profile faculty misconduct scandals in recent months . “Sexual harassment training may, in fact, make it less likely that males will recognize situations that are harassing,” said Edelman, a faculty member in the renowned UC Berkeley law school, where Sujit Choudhry resigned as dean after he was found to have sexually harassed his executive assistant . “Sexual harassment training may provoke backlash in males.” Related: ’I was expendable’: how UC Berkeley failed a woman being sexually harassed Studies testing the effects of harassment training are very limited, but some research has suggested counterintuitive and troubling consequences – that after men complete trainings, they may be more inclined to brush aside allegations and discount victims. Some researchers believe trainings have no positive effects, tend to be more about legal cover than meaningful prevention or may even have unintended negative consequences – raising serious concerns about the way colleges and companies heavily focus on training as a solution to harassment. One Journal of Applied Behavioral Science study that evaluated a sexual harassment program for university employees found that men who participated in the training were “significantly less likely” to consider coercive behaviors toward a subordinate or student as sexual harassment compared with a control group of men who hadn’t done the training. Men who completed the 30-minute training – during which officials discussed actions that constitute harassment, the harms of harassment, the importance of reporting and possible discipline – were also significantly less likely to report harassment. The men’s surprising responses may have been an “effort at self-preservation intended to defend and protect against a perceived attack on them”, the authors wrote. In other words, the training appears to make some men feel threatened and afraid that they will be subject to false accusations, said Shereen Bingham, co-author of the study and professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha school of communication. As a result, they may respond in a defensive manner. “We were surprised … it certainly appears to be irrational,” said Bingham. “The only explanation can be psychological or emotional.” The findings highlight a broader challenge – that men in leadership roles sometimes struggle to relate to the experiences of those who have faced harassment, she said: “People in powerful positions don’t have a good grasp of what it’s like to be in a non-dominant group.” Other studies have shown that when workplaces actively inform men of sexual harassment policies, it can also have unintended negative effects. A study published in the Social Psychology Quarterly found that after men learned about harassment rules, it triggered implicit gender biases, effectively making it more likely for them to stereotype women. Related: Former UC Berkeley provost: sexual harassment victims deserve ’justice’ “The purpose of sexual harassment policy is to make men and women more equal in the workplace,” said Justine Tinkler, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Georgia and co-author of the study. “If the policies are sort of activating gender stereotypes rather than challenging them, they may not be promoting that broader goal.” Tinkler has also studied how sexual harassment trainings can provoke backlash and how people who say they support harassment laws are resistant to the enforcement of those policies. Trainings can also reinforce men’s feelings that women are “emotional and duplicitous in the way that they both want sexual attention, but don’t want sexual harassment”, she explained. Edelman, the UC Berkeley professor, said she suspects the backlash could stem from the “cartoonish, somewhat unrealistic” harassment examples that trainings often include – lessons that can make participants skeptical and resentful. Edelman’s own research has focused on what’s known as “ symbolic compliance ”, which refers to the way organizations’ anti-harassment and diversity policies and procedures are primarily focused on demonstrating compliance in a legal context – and likely do little to actually reduce discrimination or harassment. What’s clear is that there’s minimal research suggesting that standard harassment trainings have a positive impact and an overall dearth of studies on the subject, Edelman said. “We really need more research on what works. All we really know about sexual harassment training is that it protects employers from liability. We don’t know whether it protects employees. We don’t know whether it reduces sexual harassment.” In California, employers with 50 or more employees are required by law to provide at least two hours of harassment prevention training, and in the University of California , all faculty and supervisors must complete a training every two years. Despite those training policies, UC Berkeley administrators and professors have repeatedly harassed subordinates and students and faced light punishments after the university substantiated allegations. That includes a famous astronomer , a tenure-track professor and the law dean , who was ordered to take a training course after he was found guilty. The questionable research makes clear that universities should not only study the effectiveness of training, but should also prioritize other mechanisms to promote prevention, professors said. “The university should focus more on having a much clearer zero-tolerance policy with very clear sanctions that are very consistently carried out,” said Edelman. Tinkler said the best way to combat workplace sexual harassment is to reduce gender inequality and promote women in leadership positions. “It really requires changing workplaces that have gender inequality structured into the way that they are organized,” she said.

'Google Google and Microsoft have made a pact to protect surveillance capitalism Two bitter rivals have agreed to drop mutual antitrust cases across the globe. Why? To fend off the greater regulatory threat of democratic oversight Academic Shoshana Zuboff says that tech firms have exploited an unregulated space to build vast businesses. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters Monday 2 May 2016 08.59 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 12.06 EDT Share on WhatsApp Microsoft and Google, two of the world’s greatest monopolies, have been bitter rivals for nearly 20 years. But suddenly, in late April, they announced a startling accord . The companies have withdrawn all regulatory complaints against one another, globally. Rather than fighting their battles in public courts and commissions, they have agreed to privately negotiate. This is a gentleman’s agreement. The specifics are secret, but the message on both sides is that the deal reflects a change in management philosophy. Microsoft’s new chief, Satya Nadella , is eager to push the vision of a dynamic, collaborative Microsoft, partnering with everyone from Apple to Salesforce. The most dramatic of these partners is Google , a company that has long been considered Microsoft’s great arch-rival. The wind started to change in September, just after Sundar Pichai became Google’s chief executive , when the two companies agreed to stop feuding over patents – a first step toward the current agreement. The common corporate line is that the companies want to compete on products, not court cases. Related: The Observer view on how Europe can stand firm against Google But this public relations gambit masks two far more interesting tales. One is about Microsoft and its desperate chase for relevance. The other is about Google, money and power. Both are part of a broader, deeply worrying narrative – a story about how tech companies are busy redrawing the lines around our lives, and facing little resistance in doing so. Waste and fury Nobody ever wants to start a legal fight. Fractious, painful and wasteful, they divert huge resources, often for little productive gain. But this in itself fails to explain Microsoft’s decision to drop pending regulatory complaints against Google in Europe, Brazil and Argentina, as well as to cease funding and participating in lobby groups that it has backed for eight years, such as FairSearch.org and ICOMP , the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace. So what does explain it? It could be seen as a pragmatic move. Microsoft’s profits still exceed Google’s, but the ratio has been in decline for a decade. Meanwhile, since 2012, Apple has outstripped both companies combined (even if recent figures suggest this momentum might be slowing). A suite of regulatory enquiries into Google’s alleged abuses of its monopoly will continue even in Microsoft’s absence – both in places where Microsoft has filed complaints (Europe, Brazil, Argentina) and in others where it hasn’t, such as India. With Microsoft’s withdrawal, it is clear that the remaining complainants in these fights – generally small, niche internet businesses – are legitimate critics in their own right. But then again, it takes serious coordination and resources to sustain and succeed in antitrust fights. Winning, especially in a broad and generally impactful manner, is a much taller order without a deep-pocketed supporter such as Microsoft. New Microsoft But there’s another possible, rather more cunning, motive. Microsoft today is facing a very different business ecosystem to the one it dominated in the 1990s. It needs to adapt. And it appears to want to do so by positioning itself at the heart of what Satya Nadella describes as “ systems of intelligence ”. Related: Google dominates search. But the real problem is its monopoly on data Explaining this concept at Hannover Messe 2016 , Nadella defined systems of intelligence as cloud-enabled digital feedback loops. They rely on the continuous flow of data from people, places and things, connected to a web of activity. And they promise unprecedented power to reason, predict and gain insight. This is unbridled Big Data utopianism . And it is a vision that brings Microsoft squarely into Google territory. So maybe Microsoft is pulling out of regulatory battles because it doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot. For emeritus Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff , this gets to the core of the Google-Microsoft deal. Google and Microsoft’s shared interest in freedom from regulation outweighs any narrower competitive interests Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff Zuboff is a leading critic of what she calls “surveillance capitalism”, the monetization of free behavioral data acquired through surveillance and sold on to entities with an interest in your future behavior . As she explained to the Guardian: “Google discovered surveillance capitalism. Microsoft has been late to this game, but it has now waded in. Viewed in this way, its agreement with Google is predictable and rational.” And here the most sinister upshot of Microsoft’s decision to stop needling Google with legal disputes becomes clear. “A key theme I write about is that surveillance capitalism has thrived in lawless space,” says Zuboff. “Regulations and laws are its enemy. Democratic oversight is a threat. Lawlessness is so vital to the surveillance capitalism project,” she continues, “that Google and Microsoft’s shared interest in freedom from regulation outweighs any narrower competitive interests they might have or once thought they had. They can’t insist to the public that they must remain unregulated, while trying to impose regulations on one another.” Standing up to power What does all this mean for the cases pending against Google? For Maurice Stucke and Allen Grunes , American antitrust experts and co-authors of a comprehensive new book examining the deep and reaching implications of platform and data monopolies, Zuboff’s warning of a lawless alliance among tech giants such as Microsoft and Google only accentuates the demand for rigorous, intellectually led regulatory action. And when it comes to Google, the case for action is in their view clear. The FTC’s failure to take meaningful antitrust action against Google is one of the great failures of all time Allen Grunes, antitrust expert “The one thing that any antitrust regime absolutely has to do, if it is to be effective, is to stand up to the most powerful companies of the time,” explains Grunes. “Take that away and antitrust ceases to be meaningful. “The antitrust authorities in the US and EU did that in the case of Microsoft. It required brains, resources and relentless pursuit and commitment.” Yet only the Europeans, he argues, seem to have the intellectual leadership to be doing it in the case of Google. “The failure of the FTC to take meaningful action against Google is without question one of the great failures of all time.” Microsoft and Google’s new deal to stop fighting each other is an interesting, strategic corporate move. But it is a move accompanied by a much stronger, deeper play: to collect and capitalize data – including data about us, our behaviors, and our interactions. The challenge for regulators and citizens is complex but essential – and has only just begun. ',?
'Share on WhatsApp It’s a question that has haunted the minds of high-flying financiers, self-help authors and regular Americans for decades: what’s the best way to make money investing? In the past, the best way, hands down, was to have won the genetic lot: to have been born so that your peak earning and investing years coincided with a bull market. If you came of age in the early 1980s and started investing, you’ve already won the game. Those years saw an extraordinary bull market in the bond market, and the three decades since included what became a golden age for stock market investors. Related: Times are hard for bankers – but they did nearly bankrupt the planet Sure, the stock market’s path was a bumpy one, with downturns, mini-crashes and other more serious bursts, like of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Overall, however, returns greatly exceeded historical averages, and recessions cleared the way for the market to climb to greater heights. Consulting company McKinsey is now warning us that the factors that contributed to those golden age returns don’t exist any more. But the era lasted long enough to make Americans think of it as normal, and to leave us wondering about what feels like an “abnormal” environment of volatile markets and mediocre returns . That, the McKinsey analysts argue in a new report making waves throughout the investment world, is precisely the wrong way to look at the whole matter. It was those abnormally high returns that were unusual, they point out. Now we’re heading into a period of compressed or collapsing investment returns, and we’ll need to adjust all our expectations and behavior accordingly. The McKinsey study attributes the exceptional returns to four unusual factors. A sharp decline in US inflation rates, to well below their historic average, led to a rise in the price that investors were willing to pay for every dollar of corporate earnings, or the much-discussed price/earnings ratio. A steep drop in interest rates boosted returns from bonds and also helped buoy stock prices. While global GDP growth was normal during the golden era, the researchers found that demographics in emerging markets and improving productivity worldwide boosted corporate profits and revenues, and contributed to stock market returns. Then there’s the unprecedented surge in corporate profits in the last three decades: US companies never had it so good. These factors are gone. It’s time to brace for a period in which investment returns could be lower than long-term averages. Between 1985 and 2014, the US stock market delivered returns of 7.9%, on average, every year; the bond market rewarded investors with an average annual return of 5%. Over the next 20 years, look for those figures to shrink to as little as 4% to 5% for stocks (if you’re cautious about the economic outlook), and zero to 0.1% for bonds. If you take a more upbeat view of the economy, you can ratchet the figures up to 5.5% to 6.5% for stocks, and 1% to 2% for stocks. Well, that’s OK, isn’t it? You could put all your money in stocks and ignore bonds – how much difference can a percentage point or two make? You could also put all your eggs in a proverbial basket, and ignore the details. While you’d be right to favor stocks in any asset allocation model (they tend to perform better over the long haul), you also need diversity. As the crisis of 2008 reminded us all, there will be periods when if you don’t have at least part of your portfolio in safer investments, such as bonds, you’ll end up losing capital. A similar look at the long term shows that a single percentage point can make a very, very big difference. Let’s say that you’ve got $100,000 and you’re earning an annual return of 5.5%. At the end of 30 years, assuming you have reinvested all of the money you make, thanks to the magic of compounding, you’ll have about $500,000. But if your returns are only 4.5%, that sum will fall to $375,000. A single percentage point has cost you $125,000 over 30 years. A decline of two percentage points, and you’ve lost nearly half of your total potential returns. McKinsey’s message is that investors need to lower their expectations, work more years and double their savings. While many advisory firms don’t find much to quibble about in McKinsey’s conclusions, some aren’t as willing to tell investors to simply give up. “McKinsey’s take on lower returns is spot on, in our opinion,” says a memo from New Jersey investment advisor RegentAtlantic. But it also argues there are parts of the market – such as the emerging markets, and smaller companies in those markets, in particular – that offer higher returns (and more risk). The report, however, merely articulates handwriting that’s been on the wall for a while. But it does warn that it’s going to be much, much more difficult for any of us to recover from any financial mistakes that we make. The markets aren’t going to give us a helping hand. Related: A real profits recession may be on its way – but there’s no need to panic So when you read lists of financial tips such as starting to contribute to your 401k as soon as you can, don’t see them as suggestions – they’re commandments. If the market isn’t going to help increase the amount you save, you’ll have to do it, making every dollar you put aside more valuable – and the dollars you save in your 20s will always be vastly more valuable than those you invest in your 40s or 50s, thanks to compounding. Just do it. Similarly, watch out for some of the worst financial pitfalls you can make: dipping into that 401k, except in the direst of emergencies; racking up credit card debt and making only minimum payments; buying more houses than you can afford. Even paying for private schools from kindergarten through college, or helping to finance your child’s wedding, can be a mistake if you’re doing it at the expense of funding your own retirement needs. Yes, you are investing in your children’s future (or the future health of the florist or wedding photographer’s businesses), but how will they feel when, in 15 to 20 years’ time, they realize that the price for that financial help is ongoing financial support? In a low-return environment, with investment tailwinds transformed into headwinds, those are some of the tough trade-offs that we’ll have to wrestle with. Like it or not, it’s time to prepare for the “new normal”. Topics ',?
'The Observer Are slow iPhone sales just a blip or is Apple starting to struggle? The volatile market in China, the urgency for a new product, and slumping phone sales are combining to create serious problems for the tech company In Silicon Valley the motto is ‘ innovate or die ’ and growth is everything – but critics argue that Apple, famous for its internal culture of aggression and secrecy, has lost its innovative edge. Photograph: Carlo Allegri / Reuters/Reuters Saturday 30 April 2016 10.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 1 May 2016 14.09 EDT Share on WhatsApp Self-made billionaire investor Carl Icahn is known for his very vocal endorsements and criticisms of the world’s biggest public companies, including Apple . Yet when he appeared on CNBC on Thursday, he wasn’t there to demand the company give shareholders dividends, as he’d been doing for years. Instead, he said he was out. Icahn said he’d dumped every share he held in Apple, claiming he made a $2bn profit and was done with the company, citing concerns about how the Chinese government could block the company from that market. “You worry a little bit, and maybe more than a little, about China’s attitude,” Icahn said , warning of a “tsunami” of trouble. Watching the broadcast was Dan Nathan, who runs the influential market analysis site Risk Reversal . “The jig is up for Apple,” Nathan said. “The big money’s known that for a while. But people love their iPhones so much, and the tech press are all fanboys, so people haven’t talked about it.” Wednesday marked the end of an era in Cupertino as Apple reported its first ever drop in iPhone sales, sending the company’s stock down to about 30% off its all-time high in May 2015. iPhone sales in China – a crucial market for Apple to continue growing – have plunged 26% as its economy stalls, with some reports indicating the Apple brand is losing prestige there . In the US, customers are upgrading their phones more slowly as the differences between generations, like the iPhone 6 to 6s, become more incremental. Related: Billionaire investor Carl Icahn sells entire stake in Apple Those bullish on the company say that the slowdown is inevitable as the smartphone market matures, and that Apple will find another game-changing product. In the meantime, the business is good: Apple pulled in $50.6bn in revenue and $10.5bn in profits this quarter. And its CEO has won a high-profile public battle against the FBI over phone hacking, showing Silicon Valley’s unprecedented power . “It was 30 years between the Macintosh and the iPhone,” said Jean-Louis Gassée , once an engineering head at Apple who shepherded the early Macintosh and now watches the company closely. “It takes time for these major waves.” But in Silicon Valley, where the motto seems to be “ innovate or die ”, growth is everything. And critics argue that Apple, famous for its internal culture of aggression and secrecy, has lost its innovative edge. Despite criticism, Apple Music has grown to 13 million subscribers - a bright spot in ​​Apple’s financial results​ Analysts say the company has not had a distinct hit product in recent years. The company tightly guards its Apple Watch sales figures, but researchers see numbers slipping in favor of wearables that use Android software – made by Apple’s arch-rival Google. Reviews of the new Retina MacBook were tepid. Tech news site the Verge liked the “beautiful” machine but found it slower, impractical and expensive, so the reviewer went back to his older Mac , while industry site The Loop described the company’s Apple Music service as a consumer “ nightmare ” because of technical and design problems. Despite criticism , Apple Music, has grown to 13 million subscribers, a bright spot in Apple’s recent financial results. The most important issue facing Apple, analysts say, is how it can expand internationally. In China, the company’s most important new market, the number of people who can stretch for an aspirational product such as an iPhone has topped out, Nathan said. The average iPhone, without wireless service contracts, cost $687 in the last quarter of 2014, according to ABI Research and the Wall Street Journal – three times more expensive than an Android device, which typically sold for about $254 globally. But World Bank data from 2015 shows that in China the average income is $7,400 – meaning that an iPhone would cost the average Chinese person more than 10% of their annual salary. “It’s an expensive phone,” Nathan said. “And the high end has become saturated.” Nathan said the best bet would be to expand into the lower end, which the company is doing somewhat with their new 4in iPhone SE . But a past effort at a bargain product, the colorful, plastic iPhone 5C, was widely seen as a flop . “That was three years ago, though,” Nathan said. Tim Cook, who took over as CEO after the company’s iconic founder Steve Jobs died in 2011, is an expert in supply chains rather than product design. Where Jobs was obsessed with the product specs, Cook is more focused on spending projections, according to a rare authorized profile in Bloomberg News that sought to prove the new CEO wasn’t just “ Jobs’s logical, icy sidekick ”. On Wednesday, Cook said that broader market issues were causing the slow in growth, and recognizing that critics were worried about China, seemed to reference the notion that Apple was no longer Silicon Valley’s star. “[We] may not have the wind at our backs that we once did,” Cook said of the company’s efforts in China . “But it’s a lot more stable than what I think the common view of it is.” Related: Apple CEO vows after company loses over $40bn in value: ’This too shall pass’ Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies technology market research firm, said there is little Apple could have done better given the broader smartphone market. The company is a victim of its own success, he argued. “There’s contentment with consumers at large who look at their phones and say, ‘You know, this thing’s pretty great, I don’t know if I need a new one,’” Bajarin said. “You’ve got to give someone a reason to buy a new device.” Bajarin thinks the market overreacted to the iPhone sales numbers, since the company sold as many phones as it had said it would this quarter. “It wasn’t a surprise. They came in just above the bottom end of their own guidance,” Bajarin said. “All of this now is just about managing Wall Street.” The company, with its $233bn in cash, has been been using that money to buy back its own stock and pay shareholder dividends to encourage investors. “Apple has the ability to be patient because of that money, but everyone will say they also have the ability to be complacent,” Bajarin said. “But I don’t think that’s their plan.” The command and control that reigns at Apple is not necessarily working in its favor anymore. Jean-Louis Gassée, former Apple engineer and investor “Nobody believes they’ll be like, ‘yeah, that’s it, we rode the smartphones and we’re done’,” he added. “They’re out looking for the next thing right now.” Others argue, though, that Apple’s culture has become uniquely problematic and is getting in the way of innovation. Tim Kuppler, who advises corporations on better workplace environments through the firm Human Synergistics , is working on a study of 30 tech company’s cultures. “If you’re at Apple, there’s so much secrecy, you can’t bring your 100% because there are certain things you can’t even talk about,” Kuppler said. “It’s very difficult in that environment for people to live up to their potential. You’ve got chains on; you’re riding the brake. That’s very different now at places like Google that are more achievement oriented.” For Apple, issues with culture may be affecting recruitment and retention. The company recently lost the head of their electric car operation as well as a longtime designer who worked closely with design team chief Jony Ive. There was an era in Silicon Valley when critics rarely voiced opinions on the unassailable Cupertino powerhouse, where strong hierarchies and control are woven into the corporate culture. Now sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be turning against the company. Even on the quiet streets of Palo Alto, Cook runs into trouble. “He was all by himself, and I gave him a 30-second harangue about the App Store,” said Gassée , who ran into Cook at a shopping mall earlier this year. “Growth hid a lot of shortcomings for Apple. When you grow fast you can be a little disheveled, dirty. Now Apple has to revisit what it’s lacking.” Gassée, who left the company in 1990 and has since become an investor, said Apple’s culture of tight hierarchies and aggressive managers wasn’t working for them in the new modern climate: “The command and control that reigns at Apple is not necessarily working in its favor any more.” ',?
'The Observer Raunchy French TV epic Versailles enlists British actors to usurp Wolf Hall’s crown Young stars of Merlin and Vikings head the cast bringing Louis XIV’s lavish court to life, as France’s £20m ratings smash comes to BBC2 George Blagden as Louis XIV, third from left, and Alexander Valhos, far right, with the cast of Versailles. Photograph: Canal+ Vanessa Thorpe , arts and media correspondent Saturday 30 April 2016 19.04 EDT Share on WhatsApp Welcome to the French Wolf Hall. Versailles, a historic court drama to rival the Hilary Mantel epic for sexual and political scheming, with lavish locations to dwarf Downton Abbey, is coming to BBC2 later this month. But amid the intrigue and affairs of the heart, the biggest surprise to viewers may be that this French production was made in English and stars two young actors from this side of the Channel. “At first we thought we were going to get our heads ripped off,” said Alexander Vlahos, from Llantrisant, near Cardiff. “A pair of British actors daring to play these historic French characters. But it has gone down very well.” Vlahos, 27, already known to British audiences as Mordred in the final series of the BBC1 family drama Merlin, plays the decadent role of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, and is at the heart of the intrigue and many of the explicit encounters in the show. Known simply as Monsieur in court circles, the duke was the brother of the fabled Sun King, Louis XIV, who is played in the show by fellow British actor George Blagden. “George is 26 and had been in Vikings on British television, while I had been in Merlin, but we were not household names, so playing the leads in this has been extraordinary,” Vlahos told the Observer this weekend. “This whole show is about the power game between the two brothers. We know there is a lot of interest in period drama at the moment, but the cast in this one are of an average age of around 25, so it does feel quite different.” Pinterest Alexander Vlahos as ‘Monsieur’ Philippe d’Orléans in Versailles. Photograph: Canal+ “People like labels so, yes, it is a period drama, but not in the conventional BBC sense, or even an ITV sense. Historically speaking, court etiquette should really have been more of a feature, but we didn’t want it to be too stuffy.” The opulence of the 17th-century French court is central to the story. “It was insane that such young men had so much. And at that time in France there were not many maps, so the king really believed he was at the centre, not just of France , but of the known world.” I didn’t quite know how big it was, [then] at the costume fitting I realised they were spending £20m on it Despite initial misgivings about the English-language production, the show has been a huge ratings success in France . Its enormous budget, thought to be around £20m for the first series, and its stylised narrative tricks have provoked comment, but the second series is already filming back on location in Versailles. Breaking from four hours of fight scenes, Vlahos said that he had not been prepared for the ambition of the project when he arrived on set to film the first series, which was broadcast in France from November last year. “I didn’t quite know how big it was. I had done an audition and then gone out to New York to appear on Broadway with Kenneth Branagh in his Macbeth. Then the producers called to offer me the job in Paris. At the costume fitting I realised that they were spending £20m on it.” The show is the most expensive ever made for French television. Canal+, which made Spiral and The Returned, has spent more than £2m on each of the 10 hour-long episodes. “It is political and it is raunchy,” said Vlahos. “The scripts lured me. I read two episodes and felt they were genuinely doing something new. I am proud of it for that. Philippe is a cross-dresser and a warrior. He has a wife, Henriette, and a gay lover as well. In one or two screen moments he has to express love, anger and then sorrow. George has had the opposite experience. “As the king, he has to be very contained and regal. Even a royal smile was thought of as a weakness at that time. George got rather put in a collar for this role, while I was let off the lead.” Pinterest Alexander Vlahos is known to British audiences for playing Mordred in BBC1’s Merlin. Photograph: Leigh Keily The first series follows the early years of Louis XIV’s reign, from when, at 28, he moved his court to Versailles to gain more political currency. “There is a lot about pushing against the old form going on,” said Vlahos. “Instead of staying in Paris, Louis decided to uproot and set up in this swampland. He wanted to be seen as a real king and a king, as he said, not just of Paris, but of the whole of France.” The show’s British creators, David Wolstencroft and Simon Mirren, are the latest examples of a long tradition of Brits to be fascinated by the court of Versailles. Fifty years ago Nancy Mitford scored a literary hit with her Louis XIV biography The Sun King, while Antonia Fraser’s study of the women of the French court, Love and Louis XIV: The Women in the Life of the Sun King, also remains popular. Approaching the showy role of Philippe was a challenge for Vlahos at first. “I come from that school of acting where you trust your instincts, rather than endlessly researching things. But as far as Philippe’s cross-dressing went, my insecurities as a person, not as an actor, got in the way. But then the director asked, ‘How would Bowie or Iggy Pop do this?’ and that turned a key in my mind. As a child, Philippe had been forced by his mother to wear dresses to show that he was no threat to the king. He got to like it, partly because it was a way of showcasing his personality. He wanted all eyes upon him and he wanted people to talk about him.” People will soon be talking about Philippe again, in the US as well as in Britain, when the show is screened there at the end of the summer. PALACE HISTORY 1623 The Palace of Versailles symbol of the French ancien régime, begins as a hunting lodge, built for Louis XIII in a village 12 miles south-west of Paris. 1661-1678 It is expanded by architect Louis Le Vau, with gardens landscaped by André le Nôtre and fountains by designer Charles Le Brun. Highlights include the much-copied Hall of Mirrors. 1682 Louis XIV moves his entire court to Versailles and sets up his “gilded cage” of privileged Bourbons. 1779 Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI, moves into the petit appartement de la reine, the queen’s suite. She played milkmaid in a faux dairy farm in a “village” in the park grounds. 1783 The Peace of Paris, in which Britain recognises American independence, is signed at the palace. 1789 The French revolution sees the beleaguered royal family return to Paris, staying in the Tuileries Palace under close guard.

'Chernobyl nuclear disaster Has the Chernobyl disaster affected the number of nuclear plants built? Thirty years on from one of the worst radiation leaks in history, several countries have moved to phase out nuclear energy production altogether, and experts say another accident would kill the industry Aftermath of the 1986 catastrophe. Ukrainian officials have estimated that the area would not be safe for human habitation again for another 20,000 years. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/Shutterstock Charlotte Beale Related: Chernobyl nuclear disaster 30th anniversary – in pictures This week marks 30 years since an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine led to a huge leak of radiation across eastern Europe. The disaster is thought to have caused thousands of cancer cases. It was the only event classed as a “major accident” by the International Atomic Energy Agency until the 2011 meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan . The data demonstrates its impact: in the 32 years before Chernobyl, 409 reactors were opened, but only 194 have been connected in the three decades since. Nuclear reactors connected since 1986 Chernobyl disaster Number of nuclear reactors connected since 1986 Chernobyl disaster. There were other factors in play, too. Yes, some of the change was directly down to the disaster in Ukraine. Italy, for example, voted in a referendum soon afterwards to stop producing nuclear energy. Related: Chernobyl, Ukraine: the nuclear option holiday However, consultant nuclear engineer John Large says that regulations and transparency demands introduced in the wake of a 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania actually had a bigger impact. “Fukushima will have the same effect,” he says. The disaster in Japan prompted the German government to phase out its plants , with the last one closing in 2022. “Nuclear energy is failing because it is simply too expensive,” says Dr Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the Energy Institute, University College London. “If there’s another nuclear accident in the next five or 10 years, you can say goodbye to the industry.” ',?
'Data and computer security Supreme court grants FBI massive expansion of powers to hack computers Intelligence committee senator said he plans to introduce bill to block expansion to ‘rule 41’ on warrants for suspects who hide their location, set for December Friday 29 April 2016 17.02 EDT Last modified on Friday 29 April 2016 20.33 EDT Share on WhatsApp The US Congress has seven months to block a potentially massive expansion of the government’s ability to hack into suspects’ computers. At the FBI’s request this week, the supreme court ruled that federal judges should be able to issue hacking warrants to federal law enforcement for anywhere in the US if the suspect has tried to hide their location, as criminal suspects are wont to do. Additionally, the FBI could get authority to infiltrate any computer – regardless of the owner – if it has already been taken over by bad hackers. The changes to so-called “rule 41” go into effect 1 December unless Congress acts to block them. The move has set up a showdown with Senator Ron Wyden, the most senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, who is marshaling the opposition on Capitol Hill. He told the Guardian on Friday that he plans to introduce a bill blocking the court’s move. Related: FBI demands new powers to hack into computers and carry out surveillance The debate offers a unique window into the struggle to maintain America’s protections against unreasonable searches in the digital age. Many of the rules were written for a world based on searching physical spaces, like a desk, and at distinct locations, like an office. Such rules often don’t adapt well to the era of the internet and ubiquitous online services, where it is also possible to, in theory, search millions of computers at the same time. Related: FBI confirms it won’t tell Apple how it hacked San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone The issue flared up earlier this week when two judges struck down search warrants for suspected users of child sex abuse websites. The FBI had taken over the website in an attempt to trap users and eventually searched hundreds of computers after a federal magistrate in Virginia issued a warrant to hack all visitors to the website. The government reasoned this was permissible, in part, because visitors to the site were trying to conceal their location by using the Tor browser, which can help anonymize internet users. In this case, the FBI had found a way to hack the service to unmask visitors to the sex abuse website. Civil liberties advocates, acknowledging the ickiness of the case, cried foul. Not because they wanted to defend child sex abuse material, but because, they said, domestic law enforcement shouldn’t be able to search potentially millions of computers based on the authority of one judge’s order. Judges in Oklahoma and Massachusetts have ruled that the Virginia warrant targeting suspects in their territories is invalid and the evidence that they visited the sex abuse website consequently is inadmissible. And without digital proof that the suspects visited the criminal websites, there isn’t much of a case against the Wyden, without getting into the specifics of the case, said he agreed US law enforcement shouldn’t be able to conduct such bulk surveillance. “One warrant for one judge can, in effect, reach millions of computers,” he said on Friday. “This is really a big issue when you’re talking about expanding the government’s hacking and surveillance authority.” ',?
'Museums face ethics investigation over influence of sponsor BP Internal documents appear to show British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and others accommodating oil firm’s demands Protesters against BP sponsorship at the British Museum last year. Photograph: Niklas Halle’N/AFP/Getty Images Friday 29 April 2016 10.59 EDT Last modified on Friday 29 April 2016 17.01 EDT Share on WhatsApp The Museums Association is investigating claims that some of Britain’s most revered cultural institutions have broken its code of ethics in the way they dealt with one of their commercial sponsors, BP . The move follows the release of internal documents seen by the Guardian that appear to show the British Museum , National Portrait Gallery and other institutions bending to accommodate the demands of the oil company. The Art Not Oil alliance of campaign groups argues that BP influenced curatorial decision-making, shaped cultural institutions’ security strategies and used museums to further its political interests in the UK and abroad. Alistair Brown, policy officer at the Museums Association , said its code of ethics encouraged museums to act transparently and to only seek support from organisations whose values were consistent with their own. Pinterest Police at a protest against BP sponsorship outside the National Portrait Gallery. Photograph: Akira Suemori/AP “The Museum Association’s ethics committee will consider Art Not Oil’s claims if they wish to seek further guidance on this matter and will contact all parties involved to seek their views,” he added. The documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Art Not Oil alliance show: The British Museum apparently gave BP the last word on the inclusion of an artwork in an exhibition of aboriginal art at a time when the company was trying to progress the controversial offshore Great Australian Bight project . BP worked with cultural institutions to manage legitimate protests and successfully urged the British Museum and National Portrait Gallery to send staff to a counter-terrorism training programme it had set up. The oil company requested information about the involvement of trade unions at the different arts institutions amid worry that their members might be opponents of fossil fuel arts sponsorship. One email shows Pim Baxter, director of communications at the National Portrait Gallery , fighting off an attempt by BP to put its logo on the front of an NPG book about commissioning. BP responds: “OK to go on this occasion but one to discuss in our catch ups.” Pinterest The email to Pim Baxter. In another the British Museum tells BP it has heard back from the Spinifex group of female painters, from the Great Victorian Desert of South Australia, who are offering one of their works to the museum. The email, sent on 17 February 2014, has the names of the sender and recipient redacted but says: “The curator of the exhibition is keen to move forward with this so we just wanted to make sure you had no objection to this?” Pinterest Email correspondence between BP and the British Museum Another email dated 26 February 2016 from BP , also with the name of the sender and the recipient (at the Scottish National Galleries) redacted, says: “I just wanted to flag up the attached intelligence which I am sure you are already aware of. It may be that this [campaign] group will try and give you some attention in the near future to attempt to influence sponsorship leanings.” Another email from BP dated 20 May 2015 asks the National Portrait Gallery whether any staff are members of the PCS union, raising concerns that the labour group opposes oil sponsorship of arts institutions. A response cc’d to Baxter says: “I believe the PCS union does represent some gallery employees … I have shared this information with a wider group of colleagues so that we can be aware and prepared for any potential impacts.” Chris Garrard, lead author of the report, BP’s Cultural Sponsorship: A Corrupting Influence, and a part of the Art Not Oil campaign coalition, said he had little doubt the Museums Association’s code of ethics was being challenged. “We’ve always known that BP uses sponsorship deals to buy a social legitimacy that it doesn’t deserve. But now we have specific evidence of where our museums and galleries have been complicit in advancing BP’s business interests and keeping the voices of the company’s critics in check,” he said. He added: “How can we have trust in these institutions when they have repeatedly put BP’s needs before the public good?” Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary, said his union was proud to support the Art Not Oil campaign that is continuing to expose the links between multinationals like BP and our nation’s cultural institutions: “We are committed to campaigning against the creep of corporate influence and the privatisation of our cultural assets.” The issue of fossil fuel companies providing cash for the arts has become increasingly controversial but BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, insisted at the company’s annual general meeting two weeks ago that its sponsorship came “with no strings attached”. The National Portrait Gallery dismissed the Art Not Oil claims. “The gallery was not pressured to attend an anti-terrorism meeting. On this occasion it was a Met police (Project Argus) organised awareness day at BP. We feel it is essential to take advice on security issues from all relevant parties and often meet with partner organisations on the planning for the safety of our visitors and guests at events and when the gallery is open to the public.” Pinterest Anti-BP protesters at the British Museum. Photograph: Niklas Halle’N/AFP/Getty Images BP said: “The company takes security very seriously; this includes the safety and security of guests and visitors to the museums that we support. BP invited, not pressured, our arts partners to a knowledge sharing event hosted in our offices by the Met police.” On the use of its logo the oil company said: “BP and the National Portrait Gallery have a strong and longstanding relationship. The line you point to is nothing more than a discussion between partners on how to demonstrate that partnership on a relevant product.” And BP said it “never seeks curatorial influence” saying it was only helping the British Museum to acquire a work of art. It added: “We provided nothing more than funding.” The British Museum also categorically denied there was any curatorial interference in its displays: “Corporate partners of the British Museum do not have any influence over the content of our exhibitions. The situation you reference concerns the acquisition of a work for the permanent collection, which was being generously supported by BP. Originally, the museum had hoped (with BP funding) to commission a new work from the Spinifex women painters group which would have been exhibited as part of the temporary exhibition Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilisation and would have entered the permanent collection. “Unfortunately, due to time constraints the group were unable to produce a new work but instead suggested several works already made which were available for sale that the museum could acquire. The curator decided on the particular work for the collection. The reference in the email therefore was an update for the funders on this change of plan. Without this support, the museum would not have been able to acquire a large collaborative painting such as this.” A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland denied the oil company had put pressure on the arts organisation over security. “In the correspondence referred to, advice that there might be some activity or ‘attention’ by the BP or Not BP group during the final days of the BP Portrait Award exhibition was sent by a representative of BP to staff at National Galleries of Scotland. “This was something that the Scottish National Portrait Gallery was already mindful of and it’s difficult to see how it could be felt to represent undue influence. In the event a peaceful protest took place on 27 February.” BP, which has recently severed its ties with Tate Britain and the Edinburgh International Festival for what it said were financial reasons, is not the only fossil fuel company to run into criticism over sponsorship. In May last year Shell was accused of putting pressure on the Science Museum to influence a climate change exhibition it was sponsoring. The charge was denied by the company and the museum but within six months the partnership had been scrapped. Art Not Oil is made up of various campaign groups including Platform, Tar Sands Network and Rising Tide. Protests against fossil fuel companies have grown over the last 18 months as oil, coal and gas groups are seen to be hindering the switch to low carbon fuels to counter global warming. ',?
'New York Times New York Times boss sued over alleged ageist, racist and sexist hiring practices Paper denies ‘unjustified’ claims that CEO Mark Thompson introduced culture that favors ‘young, white’ and single staffers to older female and black employees Mark Thompson also faced charges of age-based discrimination while director-general of the BBC. Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters Thursday 28 April 2016 15.31 EDT Last modified on Thursday 28 April 2016 20.10 EDT Share on WhatsApp Mark Thompson, the chief executive of the New York Times and former director-general of the BBC, is facing a multimillion-dollar class action lawsuit alleging that he introduced a culture of “deplorable discrimination” based on age, race and gender at the newspaper. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of two black female employees in their sixties in New York on Thursday, claims that under Thompson’s leadership the US paper of record has “become an environment rife with discrimination”. The class action lawsuit, seen by the Guardian, alleges that the Times, which promotes its liberal and inclusive social values, preferentially favours its “ideal staffer (young, white, unencumbered with a family)” at the expense of older female and black employees. “Unbeknownst to the world at large, not only does the Times have an ideal customer (young, white, wealthy), but also an ideal staffer (young, white, unencumbered with a family) to draw that purported ideal customer,” the lawsuit, which the women’s lawyer said could be extended to up to 50 similar alleged victims, states. “In furtherance of these discriminatory goals, the Times has created a workplace rife with disparities.” Eileen Murphy, the Times’ head of communications, said: “This lawsuit contains a series of recycled, scurrilous and unjustified attacks on both Mark Thompson and Meredith Levien. It also completely distorts the realities of the work environment at the New York Times. We strongly disagree with any claim that The Times, Mr. Thompson or Ms. Levien have discriminated against any individual or group of employees. The suit is entirely without merit and we intend to fight it vigorously in court.” The lawsuit, filed at the US district court of southern New York, claims that since Thompson became CEO of the Times in 2012, after eight years as director-general of the BBC, the paper’s advertising staff has been “systematically becoming increasingly younger and whiter”. It is claimed that Thompson, who was in charge of the BBC during a series of scandals over the way the broadcaster treats older women including newsreader Moira Stewart, Countryfile’s Miriam O’Reilly and Strictly Come Dancing’s Arlene Phillips, “brought his misogynistic and ageist attitudes across the Atlantic to New York City”. Following an age-discrimination employment tribunal brought, and won, by O’Reilly in 2011, Thompson admitted that were was “an underlying problem, that – whatever the individual success stories – there are manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the BBC, especially in iconic roles and on iconic topical programmes”. He said the BBC had a duty to “develop and cherish” the “many outstanding women broadcasters” and ensure that they know “age will not be a bar to their future employment” at the broadcaster. Thompson is said to have hired Meredith Levien, the company’s chief revenue office and a co-defendant, to “carry out his vision of the ideal workforce”. The lawsuit claims that under Thompson, who was paid $8.7m (£6m) last year, and Levien, who was paid $1.8m (£1.2m), “age, sex and race discrimination became the modus operandi at the Times”. In speeches to staff, Levien is said to have made it clear that she wanted a workforce with “fresh faces” populated by “people who look like the people we are selling to”. She is alleged to have told staff that “this isn’t what our sales team should look like”. The advertising staff, many of whom are older, black and female, said Levien’s comments were “shockingly rife with racially charged innuendos”. On its website the NYT says it is “committed to an inclusive and diverse workforce that reflects the audience, readers and advertisers we serve” and has “a staff as wide as it is deep, broad in perspective, backgrounds and experiences” so as to “capture the multitude of voices of America and the world, with true fidelity”. The claimants, Ernestine Grant, 62, and Marjorie Walker, 61, who work in the Times’ advertising department, dispute this. They claim that the company’s advertising directors, who had previously been a mix of races and ages, have become “increasingly younger and whiter”. “Older advertising directors of color found themselves pushed out through buyouts, or outright terminated, but those vacancies were rapidly filled with younger, white individuals,” the lawsuit said. They claim they were repeatedly passed over for promotion by younger white employees despite their greater experience. They also claims that “younger white individuals” at the same level as them are paid far more than they are. In addition, they claim they were “denied the opportunities to earn as much as [their] younger white peers because of her race and/or gender”. Younger white employees in advertising were also allegedly given “summer Fridays”, afternoons off in the summer, while the perk was not offered to older employees of color. Douglas Wigdor, a partner at Wigdor LLP who is representing the claimants, said: “It is astonishing that a news organization that regularly promotes liberal social viewpoints could have a double standard when it comes to blatantly discriminating and retaliating against its own hard working and dedicated employees.” The lawsuit claims that the Times’ “gender inequality is so endemic” that Jill Abramson, the paper’s first female editor, was “unable to turn around the troubling realities of the newsroom” and was fired after she complained that she was paid less than her male peers and predecessors. She was replaced by Dean Baquet, the paper’s first African American editor. Abramson is now a regular contributor to the Guardian. A 2014 survey by the Women’s Media Center researchers found that the Times had the least female bylines, proportionally, of the nation’s 10 largest newspapers. The study found that 69% of stories were written by men and 75% of opinion writers being male. ',?
'Share on WhatsApp Fast-food workers from Birmingham, Alabama , are suing their state legislature after it passed a law that put a stop to their expected pay raise. Nine months ago, the workers scored a major victory as Birmingham became the first city in the deep south to pass a law enacting a higher minimum wage. At the time, the city council agreed to increase the local minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 by July 2016 and to $10.10 by July 2017. The victory was short-lived as the state legislature passed a law earlier this year, prohibiting cities from increasing their local minimum wage, voiding Birmingham’s ordinance. On Thursday, Birmingham fast food workers, Alabama’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Greater Birmingham Ministries filed a federal civil rights lawsuit arguing that HB-174, passed two months ago, is tainted “with racial animus”. Most of the Birmingham workers who would have received a pay hike in July were African American, according to Richard Rouco, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. Related: Alabama passes law banning cities and towns from increasing minimum wage “Despite working hard for the same restaurant for three years, I’ve only gotten one 25-cent raise,” said Marnika Lewis, 23, one of the plaintiffs in the case. She works at Moe’s restaurant, earning $7.75 an hour. “I can’t afford to feed my son or heat my home on the $270 I’m paid each week, so I have to rely on public assistance just to scrape by. If the legislature and governor hadn’t illegally stolen my raise, I would have had money to pay for my son’s child care.” Another plaintiff in the lawsuit is Antoin Adams, 23, who works at Hardee’s and earns $7.25 an hour. Since Alabama has no state minimum wage, it uses the federal minimum wage that has been stuck at $7.25 since July 2009. Americans earning $7.25 an hour who work full time – 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year – make just a little more than $15,000 a year. Adams said he earns little more than $10,000 a year, before taxes. At the moment, he cannot afford to get his car fixed and often has to decide between spending money on food or treating his chronic asthma conditions. “I want to go to college, but on $7.25 saving up is impossible. I’d love to be a computer technician, and a raise to $10.10 sure would have helped me along that path,” he said. “The state stole my raise.” Related: US deputy labor secretary: ’We still need to raise the federal minimum wage’ In the wake of congressional inaction on wages, the Obama administration has come out in support of states and cities raising their minimum wage. “Since the president called for an increase in minimum wage in the State of the Union 2013 , 18 states have raised their minimum wage so we are very encouraged by what is happening,” US deputy labor secretary Chris Lu pointed out in April. “Not only states, but cities as well have taken the lead on this action.” Most recently, both California and New York passed laws that would see their minimum wages go up to $15 an hour by 2022. Although Obama had praised the two states for their efforts to raise wages, publicly he has yet to endorse a $15 federal minimum wage. Instead, he has thrown his support behind a proposal introduced by congressional Democrats, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has also publicly declared her support for raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour even as her rival for the democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders threw his support behind a $15 minimum wage. Most recently, however, Clinton has implied that she would not be opposed to a nationwide $15 minimum wage if there was a widespread support. “I hope the rest of the country will catch up with New York and California,” she said while speaking on a panel on equal pay earlier this month. Increasing the federal minimum wage would benefit women as they account for two-thirds of minimum wage workers, she said. Related: Calling for equal pay, Hillary Clinton shares little about her own experience According to Rouco, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, if Birmingham were allowed to raise its minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, it would result in a raise for more than 40,000 workers, most of whom are African American. About 74% of Birmingham’s residents are black and almost third of them live in poverty. The state’s attempt to block a minimum wage increase in Birmingham is also an insult, local leaders and officials said. “It’s really a slap in the face,” said Scott Douglas, executive director of Greater Birmingham Ministries. “And the reasons they gave for doing it? Like: ‘Oh, Alabama needs a unified minimum wage. We can’t have patchwork minimum wages’. When they are not lifting a finger to raise any wages across the state? It was like somebody slaps you and then winks. It was that kind of an insult.” Rouco said they are “firmly optimistic” about the outcomes of the lawsuit, adding that the firm is not in the habit of filing lawsuits they don’t expect to win. The aim of the suit is to get a verdict saying that the state law banning cities and towns from increasing their minimum wages cannot be enforced. In the case of such a verdict, he said, the Birmingham new minimum wage would go into effect immediately. ',?
'Rhode Island ’Mad as hell’ middle class independents shape presidential race on their terms In Rhode Island, where half of the voters don’t pick a party preference, Sanders and Trump got independents to vote in primary – and both picked up wins What lessons can other candidates learn from Rhode Island? Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA Thursday 28 April 2016 13.11 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 09.08 EDT Share on WhatsApp Without traffic, it takes less than an hour to drive from the southern tip of Rhode Island , near the beachfront town of Watch Hill that Taylor Swift calls home part of the year, to the former mill town of Pawtucket in the north, where the Pawtucket Red Sox, the AAA affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, play ball at McCoy stadium. But historically, Rhode Island hasn’t offered many attractions for presidential candidates during the primary season. A Republican needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination; the state can offer him only 19. To win the Democratic nomination, a candidate requires commitments from 2,383 delegates. Rhode Island can deliver 33, seven of them superdelegates . Add to that calculus the question of timing. Typically, by the time Rhode Island’s primary election rolls around in late April, a tiny handful of votes rarely tip the balance. Related: Hillary Clinton’s historic race: ‘Women don’t lose elections because of sexism’ But then, this isn’t a typical election year. This is a year in which the middle class has declared, to cite Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky’s iconic 1976 film Network, “I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it any more!” What those who quote that line often forget is what Beale (played by Peter Finch), says beforehand. “Everybody’s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel’s worth; banks are going bust … there’s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there’s no end to it. … All I know is that first, you’ve got to get mad.” Is anyone hearing an echo? I, for one, feel that this is what I’ve been writing about steadily since 2008. Now we’re in an election season in which everyone other than the wealthiest Americans is feeling the pinch, and finally getting very, very mad indeed. A well-known author and critic, Neal Gabler, has just penned an essay for the Atlantic confessing that he is one of those suffering from “financial impotence” , or the inability even to find $400 to cover an emergency. As he points out, he’s far from alone: 47% of Americans find themselves in that plight, according to one study. And millions of Americans are succumbing to a form of economic despair, a factor that has been cited as one of the contributing factors in sending the US suicide rate to a 30-year high . This campaign features two candidates tapping into Americans’ economic despair, and their renewed fury, in different ways. On the Republican side, Donald Trump promises to “make America great again”. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders pledges to oversee a revolution in both politics and business – and to cut the ties between them. Regardless of whether it’s reasonable to expect that either man could actually fix these problems , the rhetoric and promises of these two “anger candidates” have fallen on many receptive ears. That’s why Trump is the Republican frontrunner, and Sanders is still mounting a determined challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. As the winter of American discontent stretched into spring, it shouldn’t have come as a surprise the battle for Rhode Island’s tiny handful of votes – even with four other elections taking place in much larger adjacent states on the same day in what became known as the “ Acela primary ” – brought both Trump and Sanders into the state to campaign vigorously, to the surprise of some of my neighbors, unaccustomed to all this attention. Primary results Even more astonishing was the fact that Clinton and her husband, both of whom might have been supposed to be able to count on the state (her supporters include the state’s governor, Gina Raimondo, and polls tipped her to win ) both made high-profile appearances in the final days before the primary. “Hillary’s coming?” the librarian at the main branch of the public library said, doubtfully, collecting my overdue books and fines last week. “Really? I can’t remember seeing her here last time around. Wow…” The state’s primary results show just how tough and unpredictable the battle for the presidency will be this year, all the way to the White House. Of the five states in the Acela primary, Rhode Island is the only one that Bernie Sanders won, hands down, while Donald Trump’s margin of victory here was the biggest of his campaign so far . There are two important, and related, messages to draw from this. The first is the importance of voter turnout, and independent voters, in the process. The second, the magnitude of the economic anger, and its role in getting those independent voters to the polls to voter for populist or outsider candidates, such as Sanders or Trump. Even though the state opened only about a third of the usual number of polling locations – I had to walk a mile and a half each way to reach mine – and the primary was the first time that a new voter ID law was in place, requiring voters to show an approved form of photo ID in order to cast a ballot, Rhode Island’s voter turnout was very, very high – around 25%. In 2008, 27,237 Republicans voted statewide, a figure that fell to 14,564 in 2012, and soared to 61,703 this year, a 118% increase. In a solidly Democratic state, 125,846 cast their ballots for either Sanders or Clinton. Notably, Rhode Island had a “semi-open” primary, unlike the other four states that voted on Tuesday. As an independent (or in Rhode Island parlance, unaffiliated) voter, as 42% of Americans now describe themselves , I was able to vote in a primary election for the first time in my life. “And how will you be voting today?” the cheery election worker asked me, clutching a yellow (Republican) batch of papers in one hand and a blue (Democratic) sheaf in her other, sounding oddly as if she were offering me the choice between two dinner entrées. Related: Mr Smith goes to Washington: election lessons on the path of the ’Acela primary’ Half of Rhode Island’s registered voters , by some calculations, don’t pick a party preference when they register to vote. And for many of them, clearly, the flavor of the day on Tuesday, whether they opted for the yellow or the blue forms, was anger. To win, both Sanders and Trump had to succeed in motivating those independent voters to channel their anger and do more than yell “I’m not going to take it any more.” get to the polls and cast their ballots in favor of change. They accomplished that. The reasons are rooted deeply in what has happened in Rhode Island, where Raimondo, in her second year as governor, is struggling to lure middle-class jobs (and tax revenue) to the state. Manufacturing has vanished from the state; Rhode Island lost 8% of its jobs during the recession, twice as many as its neighbor to the north, Massachusetts. Taxes are high, and so is the level of political cronyism. Providence’s business leaders even urge the city to consider bankruptcy , while the mayor fights frantically to avoid it. To those who lost their manufacturing jobs, the existence of a growing, vibrant arts and creative scene, full of people lured here by the low cost of living, doesn’t make up for the lack of a living wage. Rhode Island is a microcosm of the kind of economic trauma that too many American families struggle with nationwide. Going forward, the test will be whether that economic anger will continue to power both candidates. If Sanders can’t beat Clinton to the nomination, will the combined fury of millions of disaffected independent voters or alienated Democrats, unwilling to sign up for what they see as “more of the same” incremental changes in economic policy, be enough to send Trump to the White House? Hillary Clinton shouldn’t be celebrating her victories in four states. She should be drawing lessons from her Rhode Island loss. ',?
'Amazon.com Amazon has most profitable quarter ever, but operating costs also rose The e-commerce giant saw a 28% rise in sales on same point last year, and 64% sales boost for Amazon Web Services, but costs remain a key factor for its future Amazon is currently wrestling with building its own shipping service to compete with the likes of UPS. Photograph: Ross D. Franklin/AP Thursday 28 April 2016 19.30 EDT Last modified on Thursday 28 April 2016 20.10 EDT Amazon.com traditionally has only faced one obstacle in its quest to infiltrate every aspect of consumers’ lives: it often lost money. For a straight year now, that’s no longer the case. On Thursday Jeff Bezos’ digital commerce empire reported better-than-expected profits, sending its share price up some 12% during after hours trading. The company reported a $513m profit during the first three months of 2016, up dramatically from its $57m loss during the same stretch last year. Related: ’She has a name’: Amazon’s Alexa is a sleeper hit, with serious superfans That makes it Amazon’s most profitable quarter ever and its fourth straight. The company sold $29.1bn worth of goods and services, up 28% from a year ago. The company’s spending, including the billions it spends on shipping, rose by a similar amount. Costs are a key factor for Amazon’s future. It is currently wrestling with building its own shipping service to compete with the likes of UPS. On a conference call Thursday with financial analysts, chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said, “we’re actually going to go ahead and buy some trailers”. He then noted the company recently agreed to lease up to 20 Boeing 767 jets. Amazon does not disclose how much money it makes from consumer gadgets, such as the Kindle reader or its Echo “smart speaker” . In a press release, Bezos is quoted as saying his firm sold twice as many Fire tablets as during the first quarter last year. Of Echo, he said it “too is off to an incredible start, and we can’t yet manage to keep it in stock despite all efforts”. The company did however offer details on how much it brings in from something much more pedestrian, and profitable. Sales for Amazon Web Services, which hosts websites, rose nearly 64% against the same period last year to $2.6 billion. The good news for Amazon here is that running a bunch of servers for others’ websites costs a lot less than shipping goods across the globe. Olsavsky faced questions from one analyst Thursday about how the company can continue to grow some of its popular services, such as Prime, which offers expedited shipping and more streaming programming for an upfront $99 annual fee. The service may be a hit with university students and affluent, but may seem daunting for lower income families. Olsavsky said the company is considering offering a monthly option that would entice more people to try Prime. “It is a hurdle for many people,” he said. Of course profits could be a double-edged sword for Amazon. For years, Amazon avoided large tax bills as the company plowed so much money into its operation that it ran at a loss.Now, in theory, it will have to pay more taxes to governments for staying out of the red.

'Volkswagen (VW) VW boss who quit over emissions scandal gets £13m pay package Martin Winterkorn shares in €63m pay pot for current and former Volkswagen board members despite presiding over defeat devices affair Winterkorn resigned when it emerged that 11m diesel-powered VWs had been fitted with ‘defeat devices’. Photograph: Action Press/Rex Shutterstock Thursday 28 April 2016 13.42 EDT Last modified on Thursday 28 April 2016 19.10 EDT Share on WhatsApp The Volkswagen boss who resigned over the German carmaker’s diesel emissions scandal is to walk away with €16.6m (£13m) before tax. The German automotive company said 12 current and former board members will share €63m in pay for 2015, even after agreeing to a voluntary reduction in their salaries. Their pay deals include performance-related bonuses worth €35m for 2015, a year in which the company set aside €16.2bn to cover the cost of the emissions affair. Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive who resigned after it emerged that 11m of its cars were fitted with defeat devices to manipulate emissions data, was also handed a termination payment worth €9.3m. The golden goodbye came on top of a €7.3m salary package for 2015, of which €5.9m relates to his performance for the year in which the scandal broke and led VW to a €4.1bn loss . Volkswagen has faced criticism in Germany for handing out any bonuses at all, a decision described as a “slap in the face” by Herbert Behrens, regional head of the leftwing party Die Linke in the carmaker’s home state of Lower Saxony. Speaking at VW’s annual investor conference, Winterkorn’s replacement, Matthias Müller, said he had apologised personally for the emissions scandal to Barack Obama, during the US president’s state visit to Germany. “We know that we have disappointed many people — people who have placed their trust in Volkswagen,” he said. “We stand by our responsibility. And we are doing everything in our power to regain trust.” He added that VW would make a big push into electric cars, with 20 new models to be unveiled by 2020. The company has negotiated a compensation deal in the US, under which drivers will be offered money for the impact on the value of their vehicle. But Müller said no such deal would be forthcoming in Europe, where looser requirements on diesel emissions mean less work needs to be done on affected vehicles. Dr Hans-Christoph Hirt, co-head of Hermes EOS – the stewardship arm of fund manager Hermes Investment Management – said: “There are some very serious questions under investigations, also with regard to the role of the management board. “In these circumstances, the management board should not accept any bonus at all for 2015. “They should wait for the outcome of the investigation. In the absence of them voluntarily coming to that conclusion, the supervisory board chairman should have resolved it behind the scenes. “They should have recognised that shareholders have lost a lot of money and employees face losing their jobs. It shows the lack of sensitivity that exists in Volkswagen.” VW has set aside €16.2bn to cover the cost of the scandal and said on Thursday it expects about €8bn of this to be spent on buying back diesel cars . The group admitted in its annual report that its costs could rise still further, potentially forcing it to sell assets. It also released fresh financial data detailing the recent impact of the scandal on the VW brand, by far its largest by revenue. The marque swung from a €780m profit in the fourth quarter of last year to a €127m loss, compared with strong profits at its other brands, Audi, Porsche and Skoda. The group said it was withholding data on sales so far in 2016 on the advice of its lawyers. A report into the scandal by the law firm Jones Day was scheduled to be published this month, but has been delayed. VW said the investigation had so far gathered more than 100 terabytes of data. It has collected 1,500 external storage devices, such as USB sticks, from 380 employees, some of whom have been dismissed. The company said the data had helped “trace the origin and and the development of the diesel issue to a large extent”. It believes the problem began with VW’s efforts to grow in the US, where emissions restrictions on diesel cars are particularly strict. A “group of persons – whose identity is still being determined” had responded to this by modifying engine management software, VW said. Members of the board of management had no knowledge of this, the company insisted. ',?

Photograph: Mae Ryan for the Guardian The hotel shimmers in the daylight; its windows are coated in 24-carat gold, which turns the natural light inside the bedrooms a sickly shade of green. At 64 storeys, it is one of the tallest buildings in Las Vegas and manages to distinguish itself in a city renowned for vulgarity. The lobby is heavily perfumed, with an overwhelming synthetic coconut smell. The Trump Store sells an extensive range of branded products, from Trump piggy banks and Trump cuddly toys to Trump champagne glasses and wine glasses. At the hotel’s poolside bar, H2 (Eau), Frank Sinatra croons on the stereo, Make America Great Again caps are stacked next to vintage bottles of bourbon, and a Trump quote is emblazoned on a large mirror: “As long as you’re going to be thinking anyway, think big.” David, a salesman from Brooklyn, sits on a stool drinking a gin and tonic and clutching a cigar. A Trump supporter and regular at the hotel, he describes it as “the best in Vegas”. “There’s no ding, ding, ding, like the casinos,” he says. “This is a classy place.

Celia Vargas, a 57-year-old cleaner, has worked at the hotel full time for three years, earning $14 an hour. Now a US citizen, she fled civil war in El Salvador aged 23 and crossed the US southern border smuggled inside a small container on the back of a truck. “I have always felt very proud of my work,” she said at the home she shares with her daughter and seven grandchildren. “But I feel that for Mr Donald Trump, we don’t matter as workers or as human beings.

Her insurance did not cover the full costs of treatment, leaving her in thousands of dollars in debt, and it would not pay for a full night in hospital for her to recover after surgery – her daughter came to fetch her two hours after the operation, and took her home while she was still drowsy from the anaesthesia.

'Share on WhatsApp The International Monetary Fund and others have recently revised down their forecasts for global growth – yet again. Little wonder: the world economy has few bright spots – and even those are dimming rapidly. Among advanced economies, the US has experienced two quarters of growth averaging 1%. Further monetary easing has boosted a cyclical recovery in the eurozone, though potential growth in most countries remains well below 1%. In Japan, so-called Abenomics is running out of steam, with the economy slowing since mid-2015 and edging close to recession. In the UK, uncertainty surrounding the June referendum on continued EU membership is leading firms to keep hiring and capital spending on hold. And other advanced economies – such as Canada, Australia and Norway – face headwinds from low commodity prices. Things are not much better in most emerging economies. Among the five Brics countries, two (Brazil and Russia) are in recession, one (South Africa) is barely growing, another (China) is experiencing a sharp structural slowdown, and India is doing well only because – in the words of its central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan – in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Many other emerging markets have slowed since 2013 as well, owing to weak external conditions, economic fragility (stemming from loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies in the good years), and, often, a move away from market-oriented reforms and toward variants of state capitalism. Related: Could Italy be the unlikely saviour of Project Europe? Worse, potential growth has also fallen in advanced and emerging economies. For starters, high levels of private and public debt are constraining spending – especially growth-enhancing capital spending, which fell (as a share of GDP) after the global financial crisis and has not recovered to pre-crisis levels. That decline in investment implies slower productivity growth, while ageing populations in developed countries – and in an increasing number of emerging markets (for example, China, Russia, and South Korea) – reduce the labour input in production. The rise in income and wealth inequality exacerbates the global saving glut, which is the counterpart of the global investment slump. As income is redistributed from labour to capital, it flows from those who have a higher marginal propensity to spend (low- and middle-income households) to those who have a higher marginal propensity to save (high-income households and corporations). Moreover, a protracted cyclical slump can lead to lower-trend growth. Economists call this “hysteresis”: long-term unemployment erodes workers’ skills and human capital; and, because innovation is embedded in new capital goods, low investment leads to permanently lower productivity growth. Finally, with so many factors dragging down potential growth, structural changes are needed to boost potential growth. But such an overhaul is occurring at a suboptimal rate in advanced and emerging economies, because all of the costs and dislocations are front loaded, while the benefits occur over the medium and long term. This gives opponents of reform a political advantage. Meanwhile, growth remains below the diminished potential. A painful de-leveraging process implies that private and public spending need to fall, and that savings must rise, to reduce high deficits and debts. This process started in the US after the housing bust, then spread to Europe, and is ongoing in emerging markets that spent the past decade on a borrowing binge. At the same time, the policy mix has not been ideal. With most advanced economies pivoting too quickly to fiscal retrenchment, the burden of reviving growth was placed almost entirely on unconventional monetary policies , which have diminishing returns (if not counterproductive effects). Asymmetric adjustment between debtor and creditor economies has also undermined growth. The former, having overspent and under-saved, had to spend less and save more when markets forced them to do so, whereas the latter were not forced to spend more and save less. This exacerbated the global savings glut and investment slump. Finally, hysteresis further weakened actual growth. A cyclical slump reduced potential growth, and the reduction in potential growth prospects led to further cyclical weakness, as spending declines when expectations are revised downward. There are no easy political solutions to the quandary. Unsustainably high debt should be reduced in a rapid and orderly fashion to avoid a long and protracted (often a decade or longer) de-leveraging process. But orderly debt-reduction mechanisms are not available for sovereign countries and are difficult to implement within countries for households, firms, and financial institutions. Likewise, structural and market-oriented reforms are necessary to bolster potential growth. But, given the timing of costs and benefits, such measures are especially unpopular if an economy is in a slump. It will be no less difficult to leave behind unconventional monetary policies, as the US Federal Reserve recently suggested by signaling that it will normalise policy interest rates more slowly than expected. Meanwhile, fiscal policy – especially productive public investment that boosts both the demand and supply sides – remains hostage to high debts and misguided austerity, even in countries with the financial capacity to undertake a slower consolidation. Thus, for the time being, we are likely to remain in what the IMF calls the “new mediocre”, Larry Summers calls “secular stagnation”, and the Chinese call the “new normal”, But make no mistake: there is nothing normal or healthy about economic performance that is increasing inequality and, in many countries, leading to a populist backlash – both on the right and the left – against trade, globalisation, migration, technological innovation, and market-oriented policies. • Nouriel Roubini is a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and has worked for the IMF, the Federal Reserve, and the World Bank.

'Dear Jeremy Too many tweets during work hours make my boss a twit – but how to tell him? I know every detail of his personal life from his online messages, as we don’t engage with him much at work My manager has made Twitter digs obviously aimed at staff members. Photograph: Tony Tallec/Alamy Monday 2 May 2016 02.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 02.58 EDT Share on WhatsApp Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts? I work as part of a five-strong close-knit design team for a large media/graphic design company. We have some well-known, high-profile clients. As part of what we do – essentially coming up with bright ideas – we have to bounce those ideas off one another on a daily basis and it is a joint effort. Any change in that dynamic would make our work virtually impossible. The problem is … our team leader. We regard him as management in that he sorts rotas and is in charge, so we don’t engage that personally with him. But he is very much part of the team when it comes to thinking up those bright ideas. All we know of his personal life is from social media. He details every tick and comma on Facebook and Twitter (although he has made it plain to us that going on to social media at work is a no-no!). We know when he’s been for a coffee, had the painters in, what the patio is looking like, how the grass is growing, if his football team has scored and if the cat’s had a funny turn. OK over a pint in the pub: but it is all getting too close to work for comfort. First we’ve had the Twitter digs obviously aimed at us. He seems oblivious that we’re reading them but most crucially we fear some of our clients might be, too. It could reflect very badly that a member of staff is dissing the company in public. To rub salt into our wounds, we see from the timings of the tweets that he sent them in office hours. It’s become so worrying we’re on edge day to day, wondering what’s going to be tweeted next. But we just don’t know how to approach it. Do you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com .

'Pinterest Dutch engineer William Janssen has created the Desolenator. Photograph: William Janssen Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water in both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. “I was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do ,” he said. The Desolenator, which measures 120cm by 90cm, is a solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, but also uses the heat that is generated from the sun as part of the process. In operation, water flows over the panel and soaks up the heat to bring it to a high temperature. It then flows into a small boiler in the device, which is powered by the electricity produced from the solar panel, and converted to steam. The steam is then converted back into cleaned water via a tube that changes the temperature again, while the waste flows out of the machine. Boiling the water gets rid of pollutants, said Janssen, such as arsenic and fluoride. “The device has a particle filter, a very simple filter which you can just shake empty, and the device is ready to deal with water which is slightly cloudy or slightly murky. It just flows through,” he said. There are two tubes for liquid coming out – one for the brine waste and another for the distilled water. The water flows constantly through the device during the cleaning process – one litre flows through a number of times – and small volumes of water are distilled through boiling and heat exchange. It can produce 15 litres of distilled water in a day, which Janssen said is enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. An analysis released earlier this year found at least two-thirds of the world’s population live with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen said that by 2030, half of the world’s population will be living with water stress – where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time. “It is really important that a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people and make sure there is an independence for themselves to be protected from this crisis,” he said. “If you go to places like Somalia, Yemen or Bangladesh, it is an immense problem because these people don’t have the money for desalination plants, which are very expensive to build. They don’t have the money to operate them, they are very maintenance intensive and they don’t have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants so it is really bad situation.” The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold – those who cannot afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance or by use, and middle income homes who can lease their own equipment. “People in India don’t pay for a fridge outright, they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,” he said. In the developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is unavailable – for camping, on boats, for the military or even for survivalists preparing for a doomsday scenario. Prices will vary on where it is bought. In the developing world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000 (£685) a unit, said Janssen. “We are a venture with a social mission. We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing and humanitarian world and that this the way we will proceed. We do realise that to be a viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,” he said. The company itself is based at Imperial College London although Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has so far raised £340,000 in funding. Within two years, he said, the company aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia, northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California. • You can read our archive of The Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.

'Consumer champions Airbnb cancelled our booking … an hour before we arrived We were left to wander the streets of Amsterdam trying to find Wi-Fi to sort out somewhere to stay Stranded … and left to wander the streets of Amsterdam in search of a Wi-Fi hotspot and a hotel. Photograph: Alamy Saturday 30 April 2016 02.00 EDT Last modified on Saturday 30 April 2016 04.01 EDT Share on WhatsApp In February some friends and I booked Airbnb accommodation for four in Amsterdam for three nights in early April at a total cost of £544. All seemed fine and we exchanged messages with our hosts who said they would give us the keys on arrival day. But about an hour before we arrived Airbnb called to cancel. “Personal reasons” were cited, while our hosts emailed to claim the owner had rented it to a friend. We were told that Airbnb could suggest other listings in Amsterdam but could not arrange anything for us themselves. So we were forced to spend the first few hours in Amsterdam trying to find somewhere with Wi-Fi where we could check our emails, and try to contact the new listings. Out of seven, six were already fully booked and one could only take us for the final two nights – so that would have meant finding accommodation for the first night and then spending most of our second day moving. Also, if Airbnb inexplicably cancelled a booking we made more than a month back, what was to prevent them from cancelling one we made 24 hours ago? We spent the next two hours wandering around Amsterdam trying to find a hotel for three nights. Most were either fully booked or hugely expensive. Finally, we settled on one which cost £1,665 for three nights for four people. On our return home we sent a formal email to Airbnb complaining about the appalling service and demanding compensation for, at the very least, the balance of the new accommodation. It refunded us the £544 we paid on the original booking, and has offered to refund an extra €626 (£496), which would still leave us £625 out of pocket in a situation for which we were entirely blameless. Having logged on to the site to leave a review of our booking, we found that we were unable to do so. Our account had already posted an “automated review” saying the booking had been cancelled one day before our arrival (which was untrue; it was one hour). So, despite describing itself in emails as “a community built on trust and mutual respect”, it was preventing us from giving honest feedback. CC, Brussels, Belgium Cancelling just one hour before arrival is shocking. Initially, we didn’t get much joy out of Airbnb, whose terms and conditions state that last-minute cancellations may happen, but that it takes steps in these situations to offer an alternative. It has 2m listings in 34,000 cities, and knows that things will go wrong now and again. Anyone reading of your experience will conclude it has not got sufficient procedures in place to handle such situations efficiently and sympathetically. It did not help that, when we got in touch, it bluntly refused to discuss the detail. Instead it sent a statement saying: “Over 80 million guests have had safe, positive stays on Airbnb and issues for hosts and guests are incredibly rare. “When we are made aware of issues, our customer experience team works around the clock to help make things right. “In the interest of providing excellent customer service, we are in contact with the guests and are providing them with our support.” The better news is that our intervention seemed to trigger a rethink in your favour and you were later emailed by a customer service representative. It said: “We are terribly sorry that your trip has been affected by this experience and we understand your frustration on this occasion. “Having looked through all the circumstance, having weighted all facts, we have decided your case to be exceptionally rare. You will be receiving £1,121 to cover the difference of the hotel cost.” We are happy to report that you received this promptly. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

'Share on WhatsApp If you want to get to the heart of Radiohead as they prepare to release their new record, due in June, there is only one place you should go. It is a narrow, royal blue office in central London. Number 41 Great Portland Street to be precise, just a few doors down from the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s unprepossessing embassy and the showroom of a Danish bathroom tap manufacturer. It is the offices of Hardwick & Morris, Radiohead’s accountants. You will be extremely unlikely to be let into that building. One recent afternoon, two employees outside on a cigarette break refused to say anything about the firm, Radiohead or even the ins and outs of accountancy. “Why would you want to know that?” one asked. “It’d send you to sleep.” But that building is home to two businesses that could not be more important to Radiohead right now: Dawn Chorus Limited Liability Partnership and the appallingly spelled Dawnnchoruss Limited – the firms the band have set up over the past six months to apparently deal with all the money the record generates. Radiohead Radiohead have, in fact, got many businesses registered at that address ranging from the flippantly named LLLP LLP to the flippantly named Unreliable Ltd. There is even one called Random Rubbish Ltd (it is at the tail end of a voluntary liquidation). It seems Radiohead are not so much a band as a conglomerate, having the sort of financial structure you would expect to be more associated with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs than bands from Oxfordshire. They have been directors of some 20 companies since they formed, according to Companies House. This is not just interesting for gossip. Radiohead’s financial structure shines a light on one of the lesser discussed facts of the music industry: if you want to be a great band, it can help if you are as good at finance as you are at music, or at least have a team supporting you who are. Good business sense is not something that has historically been associated with musicians, hence the multitude of tales of managers exploiting their charges. There was Colonel Tom Parker taking so much from Elvis he earned more than the singer, and David Bowie, who was apparently brought to tears by his one-time manager Tony Defries’ extravagant spending. Even today, when such merciless managers seem few and far between, the perception is that bands are still being ripped off, if now by Spotify and YouTube. According to Brian Message of the band’s management company, Courtyard Management , Radiohead have still not decided whether to allow their new album to be streamed on Spotify, and their B-sides and rarities recently began disappearing from streaming sites , a move understood to be result from the transferral of their Parlophone albums from Warner Music to XL Recordings . The story of Radiohead’s businesses begins in summer 1993 when the band formed Radiohead Ltd to deal with touring income. That firm’s accounts reveal just how sudden the band’s rise was. In its first year, when Radiohead were getting attention due to the single Creep, it had a turnover of just £181,051 ($264,746). After costs, it made a £20 loss. But following the release of The Bends in 1995 that turnover leapt. It was £735,765 ($1,075,891) the year after the album’s release, £2.1m ($3m) after OK Computer appeared in 1997 and almost £8m ($11.7m) after Hail to the Thief in 2003. The band’s 11 non-festival gigs this year, starting in Amsterdam in May and including the US in July, will turn over some £4.5m ($6.6m) in ticket sales if you assume venues sell out at advertised prices. The sudden jump in income seemed to make the band realise they should be managing their affairs better because in May 1996 they set up W.A.S.T.E Products Ltd to produce and sell merchandise such as an ever-expanding range of T-shirts. That may not sound much, but back in the 1990s it was the rock equivalent of Jay Z setting up his own music streaming service. Radiohead went on to establish Sandbag, a company offering W.A.S.T.E’s expertise to others, which in turn got its own warehousing and distribution arm, Quicksand Distribution, and an American subsidiary, Eleventy Five, whose business is uncertain (no one from Radiohead would comment for this piece). The one business move Radiohead are famous for is In Rainbows – the album they self-released after leaving EMI , allowing fans to pay what they wanted for it. It was everything you have read about it: a money-spinner for the band, a critical success and something that scared an entire industry. But it is also what turned Radiohead into the conglomerate they are now. The band set up _Xurbia_Xendless Ltd apparently to deal with that record’s income and they have formed similar companies for every record since. Their approach appears more complicated than other British musicians. Indie band the xx, for instance, are directors of just one British-registered company between them. Adele is director of five despite appearing to earn far more than Radiohead – one of her firms made £13.8m ($20.2m) profit shortly after she released the album 21. When that dropped to £3.2m ($4.7m) in the next accounting period, its accounts contained a note promising it was nothing to worry about. Even Paul McCartney has only been a director of eight British firms, according to Companies House. Related: Fake Plastic Streams: Radiohead’s label carousel is really about creative control Why would Radiohead do this? Is it because their drummer Phil Selway is a financial whiz who loves signing returns (he’s been company secretary on several occasions)? Is it because one of their management team, Brian Message, is a former accountant? Apparently not. It is simply, boringly, because it is sensible. “It makes absolute sense for them to make each project its own separate company,” says Filippa Connor, a director of RNF Business Advisory and the only person involved in Radiohead’s finances who would talk about them, although seemingly only to correct a misunderstanding. In 2013, she liquidated Radiohead Ltd for the band, which she is keen to point out is normal practise. The firm was solvent at the time with some £2m ($2.92m) in assets. Voluntary liquidations are a great way to draw a line under such projects, she says. “Having individual companies also protects them, so if something goes terribly wrong with one business it doesn’t bring down the whole edifice,” she says. “If they had a record that lost money hand over fist, they wouldn’t want it to affect everything else. I know that’s unlikely for Radiohead, but that doesn’t stop it being sensible.” It would also protect the band if there were any accidents during a tour, as happened in 2012 before a concert in Toronto when a stage collapse killed the band’s drum technician. “I look at their business structure and it doesn’t make me say, ‘Oh my gosh,’” says Ian Mack, who teaches business at the British and Irish Music Institute (BIMM). “It just seems the right way to manage their earnings and protect them. It’s how most bands of that size operate now. Related: Radiohead have not yet decided whether to stream new album, says man from their management firm “Does it remove the romance from their music?” he asks. “Of course not. I don’t think financial structures come into any musician’s head when they sit down at a piano, let’s put it that way. They can split the business side from the creative side. But this is the music business and that second word is important.” That view is shared by Dr Victoria Tischler, a chartered psychologist who specialises in creativity and is an honorary associate professor at the University of Nottingham. She would not recommend Radiohead go back to the breadline if they are ever searching for a creative benefit. “Some bands are inspired by their deprived backgrounds,” she says. “But I tend to agree with the saying that for every talent poverty has stimulated, it’s blighted a hundred. “You could equally say that the more solid a band’s foundations, the more able they are to freely create. If you’re struggling to pay the rent you’re unlikely to write a hit as you’re in survival mode. I suppose whether you think [their finances have] helped them or not really depends on if you like their records. I couldn’t possibly comment.” ',?
'Technology How much?! Snapchat interns earn $10,000 a month, twice the average US worker Tech firms such as Snapchat, Pinterest and Twitter are paying summer interns as much as $10,000 a month plus benefits, double the average US national wage Survey of college students finds the highly coveted Silicon Valley internships come with better-than-average pay and benefits – and Snapchat interns are among the top earners. Photograph: Bloomberg/via Getty Images Friday 29 April 2016 15.14 EDT Last modified on Friday 29 April 2016 20.30 EDT Share on WhatsApp Snapchat pays summer interns $10,000 a month plus $1,500 for housing, according to new survey data that highlights the jaw-droppingly high wages that Silicon Valley’s top tech companies pay students for summer gigs. The data , from former University of California Berkeley student Rodney Folz , comes from an anonymous survey of more than 500 college students who have landed highly coveted summer internships in tech, which are often engineering positions. Pinterest offers one of the highest rates at $9,000 per month, in addition to $1,000 for relocation expenses and $3,000 for housing, according to Folz’s survey results. Twitter pays interns $8,400 a month, plus $6,000 in benefits. Facebook offers $8,000 a month plus around $3,000 in benefits. Monthly pay is $7,700 at Slack and Groupon, $7,500 at Palantir and Groupon (plus housing), $7,300 at Uber and Yelp (plus other benefits) and $7,200 at Oracle and Microsoft (plus benefits). Apple pay is $6,700 a month, plus $1,000 a month for housing. Google’s pay is $6,600 a month, plus $9,000 in benefits. And Yahoo offers $6,500 a month plus $4,500 for housing. Here’s the full list: — Rodney Folz (@rodneyfolz) April 26, 2016 💰 state of top tech internship offers, 2016 #talkpay pic.twitter.com/Mkp5XWQyuE Folz sent a Google survey to a number of groups and listservs for college computer science students and tech interns and to friends with tech internships. Respondents to the survey said they had scored internships in software or electrical engineering, product design or management, industrial design and program management. Folz interned at Facebook in 2012, where he said he made about $4,800 a month in his first year at college. The median monthly base salary for an engineering intern at the big tech companies is $6,800, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of Folz’s data. To put that into perspective, that would be $81,600 a year – or $120,000 for Snapchat, $108,000 for Pinterest and $100,800 for Twitter. According to the US government, the national average wage index for 2014 was $46,481.52, or around $4,040 per month. Folz, who will soon be starting an internship at Yelp, said some of the company’s figures were unexpected. “The biggest thing I was surprised about was that the largest companies – Google , Apple, Microsoft – generally offered less in terms of monetary compensation than some of the more up-and-coming startups.” He said he wanted to publicize the salary data so that his peers would know the value of their work. Some student engineers, he noted, end up working for free on startup projects with other students, not realizing that they could get competitive wages in a summer job. “I want students to realize that... they have worth and what they’re working on matters,” he said, adding, “They can use ... compensation to pay off student loans.” Folz said he was confident that the data was reliable, especially since he directly solicited responses from friends who had recent offers. Asked about the survey results, most companies that responded to Bloomberg declined to disclose internship wages, though at least one company, Twitch, confirmed the accuracy of the survey, which revealed that interns at the video company make $7,200 a month. According to hundreds of thousands of anonymous reports on Glassdoor , a salary website, the national average intern wage is $33,120 and $48,779 in San Francisco. Glassdoor says Snapchat summer interns make $9,000 a month – slightly below Folz’s estimate. Snapchat declined to comment. ',?
'Related: Airbnb in Paris to warn hosts over illegal listings Authorities in the German capital fear the trend for people to let apartments to tourists through sites such as Airbnb, Wimdu and 9Flats is cutting into a limited property supply and driving up rents. A new law – Zweckentfremdungsverbot – has been described by Andreas Geisel, Berlin’s head of urban development, as “a necessary and sensible instrument against the housing shortage in Berlin … I am absolutely determined to return such misappropriated apartments to the people of Berlin and to newcomers”. Rents in Berlin rose 56% between 2009 and 2014 but are low compared with other major European cities at about €10 (£8) a square metre this year. As Berlin has become one of Europe’s top travel destinations, with 30.2m overnight stays last year, the Airbnb trend has affected the local hotel industry. According to research company GBI, the private online bookings represent a “parallel market of an additional 6.1m” overnight stays a year. The law was passed in 2014 but gave a two-year transition period that ended on Saturday, when owners became limited to renting only rooms via such sites, not entire flats or houses. Offenders can face fines of up to €100,000. The city has appealed to the “civic spirit” of residents, asking them to anonymously report suspected misuse online. Tim Boening, 41, who rents out a loft in the trendy Kreuzberg district, said he was not shocked by the law, given practices he had seen. He cited “the nice couple with two small apartments who move in together to a bigger place and keep the two apartments to rent them out on Airbnb … I don’t think that’s good – it should be stopped.” Related: Paris catacombs offer on Airbnb: spend the night with 6 million dead bodies But a 48-year-old woman who did not want to give her name expressed fury about the change, having rented out four apartments near the city centre via Airbnb. She claimed the city was making Berliners pay for its failed housing policy while serving the needs of the hotel industry. She was especially angry about the request to inform on offenders, saying that “in Germany , of all places, maybe we should reconsider this kind of thing”. Airbnb Germany said: “Berliners want clear and simple rules for home sharing, so they can continue to share their own homes with guests. We will continue to encourage Berlin policymakers to listen to their citizens and to follow the example of other big cities such as Paris, London, Amsterdam or Hamburg and create new, clear rules for normal people who are sharing their own homes.” Wimdu has filed a lawsuit, arguing the law breaches the constitution of Berlin. The owners of 9Flats told the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: “We face a law in Berlin that would drive us into bankruptcy.” ',?
'China’s factories grow less than expected, raising recovery doubts Economists had expected stronger growth in the manufacturing sector after recent stimulus measures by the Beijing regime Workers welding a steel frame in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province. factories are ordering fewer raw materials after recent price increases. Photograph: Stringer China / Reuters/Reuters Reuters Share on WhatsApp China’s manufacturing sector expanded less than expected in April, raising doubts about the sustainability of a recent pick-up in the world’s second-largest economy. The official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 50.1 in April, easing from March’s 50.2 and barely above the 50-point mark that separates expansion in activity from contraction. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the reading would improve to 50.4, after upbeat March data fuelled hopes that the country’s prolonged economic slowdown was easing. The findings were “a little bit disappointing”, Zhou Hao, senior emerging market economist at Commerzbank in Singapore, said. “To some extent, this hints that recent China enthusiasm has been a bit overpriced and the data improvement in March is short-lived.” Activity in China’s services industry remained strong but also grew at a slightly slower pace, with the official reading at 53.5 in April, compared with 53.8 in March. While industrial production expanded modestly (52.2) and at nearly the same pace as in March, growth in domestic and export orders faded slightly, though remaining in positive territory. In a sign of caution over the outlook, factories continued to draw down heavily on inventories of finished goods. Factories also appeared to be stockpiling fewer raw materials, possibly due to recent price increases for products such as steel, which have been linked in part to a recovery in the property market. Indeed, South Korea reported April demand from China was the worst in three months, with exports to its biggest market tumbling 18.4% on-year. And China’s factories continued to shed workers, with staff cuts quickening from the previous month. The official PMI survey, which tends to focus on larger, state firms, has shown persistent declines in employment for the last three years. March data had spurred hopes that the long suffering manufacturing sector was bottoming out, with growth in industrial output and profits improving. That in turn had led economists to wonder if the government and central bank would begin to take a less aggressive policy approach after a more than one-year long blitz of fiscal, monetary and administrative stimulus measures. To be sure, the property recovery appears to have spurred demand for building materials from cement and glass to steel, and a recent rebound in commodity prices is bringing in more cashflow for some companies to service their mountains of debt. However, home sales are now tumbling in some big cities such as Shanghai as authorities try to curb rapid price rises, and sizzling steel and iron ore markets cooled last week after China’s securities regulator ordered commodity futures exchanges to control speculative trading. Analysts also worry that recent signs of improvement may be largely driven by companies and local governments taking on more debt, putting the chances of a stable recovery at risk. China’s five biggest banks reported last week that their bad loans had increased by 53.2bn yuan ($8.21 billion) in the first quarter. ',?
'Gay finance LGBT insurer Emerald aims to bridge a sexuality gap Are lesbian and gay people still discriminated against by financial services companies? A new insurer argues they are Emerald has a great deal on wedding insurance, gay or straight. Photograph: Alamy Share on WhatsApp There is a UK insurance company that will give you cover if you are an airline pilot, but not if you are cabin crew. There are travel insurance policies that routinely bar anyone with HIV, even if the person has lived with it for years and has an almost undetectable viral load. There are policy documents that can’t cope with a Mr and Mr heading, and insist on describing married gay couples as Mr and Mrs. And family discounts that won’t be applied to homosexual partners. There are call centres that assume that when you mention your partner the person is the opposite sex. So say Steven Wardlaw and Heidi McCormack, respectively founder and chief executive of new insurer Emerald Life . They argue that while Britain’s 2.2 million lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender/transexuals rarely suffer serious direct discrimination by banks and insurers, the latter are still failing to deal with customers in a way that makes them feel comfortable when buying. “People want to know that when they call, for whatever reason, they are not going to have to correct the call centre person about their partner’s gender, or that there aren’t going to be issues over who the beneficiary of their policy will be, or that they may have children,” says Wardlaw. “Eight out of 10 LGBT individuals say they are not happy with the way they have been treated in the past.” Emerald believes the LGBT community is still waiting for a basic equality of experience in financial services, and last week launched a range of LGBT-friendly home insurance, term insurance, and wedding and pet cover, with travel insurance coming in May. Yet financial services companies have revolutionised their approach over the past decade. Lloyds is running an advertising campaign that prominently features a same-sex couple in the midst of a proposal, while Nationwide and many other banks and insurers have thriving LGBT groups. In the US, PayPal cancelled expansion plans in North Carolina in protest at controversial new rules that discriminate against LGBT citizens. Banks and insurers often come top of Stonewall’s annual listings of the best places for LGBT employees, with Lloyds and Barclays star performers in 2016. Can it really be the case that airline cabin crew are turned down for insurance because they are assumed to be gay? And why? Wardlaw says that during the course of the past two years, while researching and creating Emerald, he has been in commercial discussions with a number of insurers. He signed confidentiality agreements so cannot disclose specific details, but he found that in one instance, in the pull-down menu for occupation, if the person selects airline pilot then cover is granted, but if the occupation is changed to cabin crew – and all other details left identical – the person is declined for cover. When Wardlaw asked the insurer why, the suggestion was that cabin crew may have lifestyles that would result in more claims. But this wasn’t for a life insurance product, it was for home insurance, which makes it all the more mystifying. Are gay cabin crew so likely to make claims on their buildings and contents policies they are just too risky compared to pilots? Wardlaw admits he is befuddled, adding that he never got a straight, so to speak, answer. More understandably, travel insurance policies contain clauses that exclude claims arising from HIV/Aids, or heavily load the premium if anyone discloses their status. But Wardlaw says many of these clauses were created in the early days of HIV treatment, and no longer reflect the reality of modern treatments that have massively improved survival rates. Emerald’s travel insurance won’t ignore HIV/Aids, but will, Wardlaw says, price it rationally and reasonably. So how much will Emerald’s products cost? For many in the LGBT community, corporates sticking the label “gay” or “gay-friendly” on their products is a by-word for charging extra. Is Emerald Life any better? When Guardian Money price-tested the products, the results were mixed. Its life insurance was expensive, its home insurance middling, but its wedding insurance very cheap. The life insurance quote cost £99 a month for £200,000 of cover, while on comparison sites for the same age and address, the cheapest was around £35. But its wedding cover is the lowest cost in the market. For couples tying the knot, but worried that for whatever reason (sickness etc) they might have to cancel the event, Emerald charges £50 for £12,500 of cover, compared to £60 at John Lewis for £10,000 of cover. Critics argue that an LGBT-only company is discriminatory itself.

'Australian economy New South Wales is Australia’s strongest economy, Victoria a close second Report says Victoria has gained ‘substantial ground’ on NSW, and high unemployment has pushed Western Australia into sixth position Victoria is gaining on NSW with strong housing finance and population growth, and the fastest annual economic growth rate in the nation. Photograph: Alamy Sunday 1 May 2016 22.41 EDT Last modified on Sunday 1 May 2016 22.54 EDT New South Wales continues to be Australia’s strongest-performing economy while continued high unemployment has seen Western Australia slip again into sixth position, according to the latest CommSec State of the States report released on Monday . But the report says there is little difference between the top two states and between the bottom three. Victoria has gained “substantial ground” on NSW with strong housing finance, population growth, and the fastest annual economic growth rate in the nation. At the other end of the scale, the Tasmanian economy has improved enough to draw equal-last with South Australia after a modest lift in momentum driven by the low Australian dollar. The Tasmanian treasurer, Peter Gutwein, told Hobart paper the Mercury that he welcomed the slight improvement but there was still “a lot of work to do”. Western Australia , which had the strongest-performing economy in the October 2014 report, remains second-highest on construction work but second-lowest in business investment, population growth and housing finance. Population growth in particular has taken a dive: the end of the mining boom has seen it drop to 1.27%, down more than 50% on the decade average. The end of the boom has also seen WA ranked worst performer in terms of unemployment. The unemployment rate is 5.7% in trend terms, up from a decade-average of 4.4%. However, the report notes that at least part of WA’s low rank could be due to a change in the data used to measure economic growth, which is now measured just on state final demand figures. Related: Australian economy grew 3% in 2015 to defy end of mining boom “No doubt if exports and imports were considered, Western Australia would have been among the strongest-growing economies rather than in fifth place (for economic growth),” the report notes. The State of the States report, released quarterly, rates states and territories across eight key measures: economic growth; retail spending; equipment investment; unemployment; construction work; population growth; housing finance; and dwelling starts. The Australian Capital Territory was in third place, driven by a 21.1% increase in equipment investment in the past 12 months and strong annual population growth. The Northern Territory ranked fourth, despite continuing to lead the economic growth and construction work indicators, due to placing last in population growth, business investment and housing finance. Queensland , which had the lowest national ranking on construction work and second-lowest on economic growth, ranked fifth. “The end of the construction phase of the mining boom is clearly evident in Western Australia and Queensland,” CommSec chief economist Craig James told AAP.

'Business Italian banks under pressure as Popolare di Vicenza IPO fails Stock market in Milan forbids Italy’s eighth largest lender from listing after investors bought just 7.7% of €1.5bn share issue Banca Popolare di Vicenza headquarters in Vicenza. Italian bank shares have lost nearly a third of their value this year amid concerns about bad debts. Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters Reuters in Milan Monday 2 May 2016 13.11 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 13.12 EDT Share on WhatsApp Italian banking shares have come under pressure after the planned listing of regional lender Popolare di Vicenza flopped and the latest government measures aimed at tackling the sector’s bad loans fell short of expectations. The stock market in Milan said it could not allow Popolare di Vicenza to list after investors bought just 7.7% of its €1.5 bn share issue. Italy’s eighth-largest bank, which needs the money to fill a capital gap and avert the risk of being wound down, will be 99.3% owned by a newly created bank rescue fund that underwrote the cash call. The Atlante fund raised €4.25 bn from Italy’s leading financial institutions, at the lower end of a €4-6 bn range initially targeted. More than a third of the fund’s resources will be tied up in a single bank. Shares in banks UBI Banca, Banco Popolare, Popolare di Milano and Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit fell by 5-7%. In a sign of a growing political backlash over Italy’s banking problems, a group of small investors who had their savings wiped out in last year’s rescue of four lenders heckled the prime minister in his home city of Florence.

'Luxury goods sector Disney pins its merchandise designs on an adult audience Animation giant is raiding its archives to help designers build fashion lines based on its fabled storylines. From £3,000 Cinderella slippers to Captain America outfits If the shoe fits … Disney’s annual show at Somerset House showcased its move into brand collaborations, such as this Irregular Choice show featuring the sole of Luke Skywalker. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian Share on WhatsApp Its high street stores are meccas of overpriced tat with piles of cuddly Nemo fishes, plastic lightsabres and polyester princess outfits that send girls into a frenzy. With recent cartoon blockbusters such as Frozen, Disney has tightened its hold over children’s hearts but now it is targeting their parents too, by pitching a clothing and homeware empire aimed squarely at adults. “We did a lot of consumer research and discovered there was huge demand for adult product from Disney,” said Francesca Gianesin, who heads the Europe, Middle East and Asia region for Disney consumer products. “When we see a movie, the first thing we think is will there be an emotional connection? What is it men and women would like to feel by wearing pieces of that movie?” The division is already enjoying a strong run, with sales up 13% to $4.5bn (£3bn) last year as cinema-goers snapped up Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars-related T-shirts, toys and lunch boxes. But the target audience is not the fancy dress party goer – at the clothing and homeware event Disney held at Somerset House last week there wasn’t a pair of Mickey Mouse-style suspender shorts or a Cinderella costume with battery-operated lights in sight. Gianesin is wearing a Fausto Puglisi tunic inspired by the Captain America franchise , and is channelling superhero rather than Disney princess. “It’s about empowerment because I’m a superhero,” the Italian explained. “I’m wearing Captain America and I’m a woman, and I want to be seen as strong.” Pinterest Francesca Gianesin at Disney’s annual Lifestyle event. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian More than 1,000 fashion industry professionals trooped to the event at Somerset House, a glamorous neoclassical building on the Strand in central London, which with its cobbled square and dancing fountains is often a hangout during London fashion week. In an industry always hungry for new ideas, Disney serves up a huge archive for fashion folk to plunder : from the drawings that were the genesis of classic 1930s and 1940s animations such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Bambi to storyboards and props from the most recent Marvel films. Enthusiasm for the event was underlined by key figures such as Sandra Choi, creative director of Jimmy Choo, and Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye, president of Chloé, taking part in a panel debate on the “power of storytelling”. It is only the second time Disney has courted the fashion industry in this way, with last year’s show based on mock-ups created by Disney designers. This year several galleries were packed with the Disney-inspired output of high-end clothing designers ranging from Preen to Anya Hindmarch and Marc Jacobs as well as more accessible fashions such as a £145 pair of tiger-print Reebok trainers, inspired by its Jungle Book remake. Pinterest Disney’s annual Lifestyle event at Somerset House, London. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian Disney grants character licences for use on everything from toys to clothing and food, earning royalties on the wholesale or retail price. Its hottest properties include Frozen, Mickey and Minnie, Marvel’s The Avengers and Spider-Man – and, lest we forget, the Disney Princesses. The broad appeal of Disney is clear: its own stores sell a pair of Cinderella “light up” shoe for £16, while a bespoke pair, decorated with thousands of Swarovski crystals, can be ordered from Jimmy Choo for just under £3,000. Gianesin has reorganised her staff to create a Disney Living team, signalling an ambition to conquer the fragmented homewares market, with its characters ripe for use on everything from cushions to crockery and tea towels. Walt Disney logged the colours used to paint each character in its now classic animations, handing the company a paintbox filled with shades such as “Scat cat” purple (from The Aristocats) and “shine on ice” from Bambi. Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, said demand for “novelty and nostalgia done well” should not be underestimated. “There is a constant need for newness and storytelling in a fashion market that is quite stagnant at the moment,” she explained. “Disney is an iconic brand and part of the story of how we have grown up. There are lots of stories for brands to play with.” With a market value of $170bn, Walt Disney’s other interests include TV channels as well as the famous theme parks and film studios. Its arsenal of film rights was boosted by the purchase of Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, in 2012, having swallowed Pixar, the animation firm behind Toy Story, and Marvel Comics in the 2000s. “Whether you have children or not, it’s all about the emotional connection,” added Gianesin. “Luxury brands create new trends that move through the pyramid from luxury to trend-market to mid-market to mass market, even discount. We are part of pop culture. There are so many properties and characters that are timeless and relevant to different consumers.” ',?
'Executive pay and bonuses Norwegian wealth fund to focus on executive pay at AGMs Head of world’s biggest wealth fund says level of pay – not just their structure – are now becoming a matter for international investor concern Yngve Slyngstad, CEO of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, says boardroom pay levels are not just an issue for UK investors. Photograph: Erlend Aas/AFP/Getty Images Monday 2 May 2016 12.47 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 12.49 EDT Share on WhatsApp Boardroom bosses have been put on alert that their pay has moved beyond being a focus for UK investors after the biggest wealth fund in the world said it was scrutinising pay deals. At a time when the amount of revolts in this year’s annual general meeting season are coming thicker and faster than those in recent years, the Norway oil fund has revealed it is preparing to target high pay. Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of the fund, told the Financial Times , that the absolute level of pay – not just the way deals were structured – was becoming an issue. “We have so far looked at this in a way that has focused on pay structures rather than pay levels. We think, due to the way the issue of executive remuneration has developed, that we will have to look at what an appropriate level of executive remuneration is as well,” said Slyngstad. The Norges Bank Investment Management is so large that it holds stakes in most major companies. It supported the controversial pay deal for BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley, which was voted against by a majority of investors but, according to the FT, the fund voted against pay at Anglo American and also at Weir . Weir has faced the largest rebellion of this AGM season and was forced to abandon potential share awards for its top management team, after 72.4% of shareholders voted against its pay policies. “We are looking at how to approach this issue in the public space. We will choose the right instance for the right case of voting,” Slyngstad said. The remarks by Slyngstad come as a long list of London-listed companies prepare to hold their AGMs over the coming days, including Reckitt Benckiser, whose chief executive was paid £23m in 2015, double the amount the year before. Two banks, Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, along with Rolls-Royce, GlaxoSmithKline and hedge fund Man Group, are also holding meetings. Data compiledby ISS shows that two pay deals have already secured “no” votes – those at BP and Smith & Nephew – compared with none by this stage over the previous three years. “The average level of dissent for advisory remuneration report resolutions across the FTSE All Share continues to outpace that evidenced in recent years,” said Stephan Costa, executive director at ISS, the corporate governance consultancy. “More critically, we are seeing companies failing to secure majority support with others narrowly passing, thereby underscoring the depth and breadth of investor sentiments on pay this annual meeting season.” Costa said. The AGM season continues for a number of more weeks yet, when major companies hold their investor meetings, including WPP, the advertising company which confirmed last week that its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell had been paid £70.4m in 2015.

'BHS Select committee chief lashes out at Sir Philip Green over BHS sale Iain Wright vows to question Topshop chief on his role at BHS given that he sold it to ‘untried and untested people’ who ‘crashed it into a cliff’ BHS was sold to Retail Acquisitions after 15 years under Sir Philip’s Green’s Arcadia. Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA Monday 2 May 2016 12.09 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 12.17 EDT Share on WhatsApp The MP leading an analysis into the collapse of BHS has lashed out at its former owner Sir Philip Green over the sale of the business to people who “crash[ed] it into a cliff”. The retail billionaire, his wife Tina and Lord Grabiner, chairman of Green’s retail empire Arcadia for more than a decade, are being asked to appear before two parliamentary committees to give evidence about the high street chain’s demise. Wright highlighted the sale of the business to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt who bought BHS via a company called Retail Acquisitions last year. He said: “ The question that we want to ask Sir Philip Green is, ‘You bought BHS, took enormous sums out of the business , the pension scheme went from surplus to deficit and then you sold it for a pound to somebody who was twice bankrupt and who had no experience whatsoever of the retail sector - is that appropriate stewardship of a big, important company?’” Retail Acquisitions argues that it spent £10,000,001 to buy BHS , because it invested £10m in shares on top of the deal’s notional £1 price tag. Pinterest Sir Philip Green. Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Wright added: “So it’s a case of ‘is it right that people can buy a company, strip it, in many respects, of cash in terms of dividends without real regard to pensions or to employees and then sell it for a pound to untried and untested people who then crash it into a cliff?” He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “We are keen to find out who knew what, when. This issue over the sale and acquisition of BHS raises enormous questions .” MPs on the committee as well as those on the work and pensions committee are taking evidence on BHS. Green declined to comment. Wright added: “When you sell a business do you have any further responsibility or do you start to crash it into the cliff and then bail out just before it does crash? “Those are things we want to look at on the business select committee and we also want to see whether the system is fit for purpose in making sure we can create long-term value rather than making sure that people can extract value out of businesses to the detriment of employees and to the detriment, ultimately, potentially, of the taxpayer.” While Wright has yet to announce a list of witnesses that the business select committee wants to question, they are expected to be the same as those called by Frank Field, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee. BHS called in administrators in March, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk, a year after Arcadia’s 15-year ownership ended. Questions are now being asked about how its £571m pension deficit will affect the Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. Sports Direct tycoon and Newcastle United Mike Ashley, who has resisted calls to appear before MPs over working conditions in his own retail empire, has indicated that he could bid for BHS . Green is also thought to have considered a move to buy back the brand he once owned, while boardroom veteran and former Asda boss Allan Leighton has also been linked with a rescue bid. ',?
'Reckitt Benckiser Reckitt Benckiser executive slapped at South Korea press conference Head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan bowed 13 times during ritual apology for company’s role in humidifier sterilisers linked to 92 deaths Atar Safdar is slapped by an aggrieved relative during a press conference. Photograph: Yonhap/AFP/Getty Images Reuters in Seoul Monday 2 May 2016 11.16 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 12.36 EDT Share on WhatsApp An executive at Reckitt Benckiser was slapped during an emotional news conference as he apologised on Monday for deadly lung injuries linked to the use of humidifier sterilisers marketed by the firm. Ata Safdar, head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan, bowed several times in apology before an audience that included victims and their families, among them a 13-year-old boy who now uses an oxygen tank to breathe. The news conference in a Seoul hotel marked the first public acceptance of responsibility by the firm – known in the UK for household cleaning products such as Dettol – for its role in a bitter controversy that has raged since 2011. Related: Reckitt Benckiser, Standard Chartered and WPP in line of fire over boardroom pay The government said last year that 92 people were believed to have died from causes related to the humidifier products – not all them marketed by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, which was the group’s South Korean arm at the time. “Today’s apology, was about acceptance of responsibility for the harm that Oxy HS [humidifier sterilisers] has caused,” Safdar said. Pinterest Atar Safdar bows during a press conference. Photograph: Yonhap/AFP/Getty Images “This is the first time we are accepting the fullest responsibility, and we are offering a complete and full apology. “We were late, five years have passed, we are also apologising far too late. This is what we are apologising about.” As he spoke, a man stepped on to the stage, shouting expletives and slapping him on the back of the neck. “This is heartbreaking,” Safdar said as he asked to be allowed to continue. “I apologise again. I would request that I am allowed to finish my statement, please.” Another man who mounted the stage shouted: “It’s too late.” Sales of the sterilisers, a liquid added to the water of humidifiers, were suspended by the South Korean government in 2011. Safdar said about 178 users of its products are among those believed by the South Korean government to have been affected, and he outlined a plan to launch a compensation panel. South Korea believes 530 people had registered claims since 2011 of lung ailments from using humidifier sterilisers marketed by Oxy Reckitt Benckiser, and similar products marketed by other firms. South Korea is thought to be the only country where the products were sold, a government official said. Prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation against makers of the products. The company changed the name of its local unit to Reckitt Benckiser Korea in 2014. The apology on Monday follows a written statement last month by a local unit for failing to communicate more quickly with victims and their families. Last month, the firm established a 5bn Korean won (£3m) “humanitarian fund”, as well as a 5bn won fund launched in 2014. ',?
'Emissions trading Labor policy could increase power prices by 8% to 25%, economist says Danny Price, who helped devise the Coalition’s climate policy, says Labor scheme to shut brown-coal generators would lead to higher prices Labor scheme to shut brown-coal generators would lead to higher prices, says Coalition-linked economist. Photograph: Carla Gottgens/Bloomberg/ Getty Images Monday 2 May 2016 05.44 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 08.58 EDT Share on WhatsApp A little-noticed part of Labor’s climate policy could push up retail power prices by between 8% and 25%, economist Danny Price has claimed, with price hikes in Victoria exceeding the impact of the former Labor government’s carbon tax. Price, who helped devise the Coalition’s climate policy, told Guardian Australia last week the main plank of Labor’s policy – a new style electricity emissions trading scheme – was exactly what he designed for Malcolm Turnbull in 2009 and mirrored what the Coalition’s Direct Action plan would almost certainly have to become to meet Australia’s greenhouse targets. He said the price rises under that scheme would be “minimal” for many years. Related: Labor proposes two emissions trading schemes costing $355.9m But Price has now modelled a second plank of Labor’s policy – a scheme under which big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive to shut straight away and deal with the community and employment fallout. The cost of the winning bid would be paid for by all the other generators in the market, who would enjoy higher prices because of their competitor’s closure. The academics who first proposed the idea, Frank Jotzo and Salim Mazouz, estimated it could cause a one-off rise of between 1% and 2% in retail power bills, while recent modelling by analysis company Reputex found the impact could be even lower – between 0.2% and 1.3% – or that perhaps there would be no price rise at all. “For residential electricity bills, falling network costs may completely offset any cost impact of the new policy, with retail energy prices expected to fall out to 2020,” said Bret Harper, associate director of research at Reputex. “The closure of a large coal generator is likely to have a negligible impact on residential electricity bills.” But according to Price, in a brief to clients of his firm Frontier Economics, that did not “ring true” and he modelled the example of Hazelwood, a brown coal-fired power station that produces over 20% of Victoria’s electricity and produces 3% of Australia’s greenhouse emissions, suddenly closing down under the scheme in July 2017. Related: Why Coalition climate scare campaign is not credible and makes no sense He found this could cause a short term price shock adding up to 25% to retail prices in Victoria, falling to between 14% and 15% in a few years as investments in other energy sources came on line. In New South Wales and South Australia, connected with Victoria in the east coast electricity market, the retail price increases would be an initial 13% or 14% falling to 8% or 9% over time, he said. Despite Price’s praise for sections of his policy, Labor’s climate spokesman Mark Butler said Price “helped Tony Abbott write his Direct Action policy” and “regularly rails against our policies to expand renewable energy, so I’m not surprised that he is again campaigning against our Climate Change Action Plan”. “Labor has responded to overwhelming calls in the electricity industry for government to adopt an orderly framework around the transition from Australia’s heavy reliance on coal fired power to modern, clean energy. Mr Price’s opinion is directly at odds with modelling from the ANU and energy analysis firm, Reputex. That modelling supports electricity industry projections that average household power bills will decline in real terms over the period to 2020,” Butler said. Jotzo, an associate professor at the Crawford School of public policy, and Mazouz, a principal at the Centre for International Economics consultancy, responded to the substance of Price’s claims. “The key point is that without effective carbon pricing, an exit mechanism of some form is needed for an orderly transition from old coal-fired power stations to renewables. There is a broad consensus about this in the policy community and in industry. Danny Price attacks our proposal for how this could be achieved but does not offer any solutions,” they said. Related: Business council praises Labor’s ’bridge’ to emissions trading scheme Jotzo pointed out that their plan included “a safety valve in case the costs turn out unacceptably high. As we state in our paper, government would not need to go ahead with the closure scheme if the bids in the reverse auction were judged too high. And as Frontier point out, high expected price impacts would be visible through high payments demanded for exit, so the government would know what to expect.” And Mazouz said the Frontier modelling “assumes that the market is taken by surprise by the sudden retirement of an entire plant”. “This would not be so. The market would know the schedule for plant retirement, and indeed a plant could be phased out gradually by retiring the several units that a power station consists of one at a time. Our proposal is all about orderly transition, and any policy mechanism can be designed to be gradual and fully predictable,” he said. Price last week said “the emissions intensity part of Labor’s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009”. Price modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and considering his response to the then Labor government’s cap and trade ETS. Turnbull lauded it as a “cheaper, greener, smarter scheme” and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but impose far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, dismissed it as a “magic pudding”. Price said the new Labor policy was “a bit light on detail but it looks pretty much the same [as the Turnbull 2009 plan]. Malcolm Turnbull thought it was a good idea then. I’m delighted the Labor party is proposing it now.” Related: Direct Action ’safeguards’ will allow industry to increase emissions – analysts Price – who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action – said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself in order to meet its own emissions reduction targets. “The government’s Direct Action plan – its safeguard mechanism – could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,” he said. “I’ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it. “It is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.” Under Direct Action the “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. At the moment the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don’t “go rogue” but not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing. ',?
'English businesses ’should be forced to show hygiene scores’ Local Government Association wants mandatory display of hygiene ratings A food hygiene rating sign in the window of a restaurant in Norwich. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian Rebecca Smithers Consumer affairs correspondent Sunday 1 May 2016 19.01 EDT Share on WhatsApp All premises in England that sell food should be forced to display hygiene ratings to drive up standards and protect consumers from the risk of eating food prepared and cooked in unsanitary kitchens, local councils said on Monday. Council environmental health teams score outlets from zero to five based on factors such as kitchen cleanliness, cooking methods and food management, but businesses in England do not have to display the so-called “scores on the doors” ratings they have been given. Compulsory ratings already exist in Wales and will be introduced in Northern Ireland in October. The Local Government Association (LGA) is calling for mandatory display to be extended to England to help raise food hygiene standards at restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, sandwich shops, supermarkets and delicatessens, and to reassure consumers. The hygiene scores for more than 412,000 English premises can currently be found on the Food Standards Agency’s website. Businesses across England should by law be forced have to display their stickers at their premises or face fines or prosecution if they fail to comply, according to the LGA, which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales. “Anyone in England who sees a business without a hygiene rating sticker currently has to decide if they want to eat or buy food there without knowing what’s going on in the kitchen” said councillor Simon Blackburn, the chair of the LGA’s safer and stronger communities board. “It’s not always easy for people to judge hygiene standards simply by walking through the front door of a premise and know whether they are about to be served a ‘dodgy’ burger or kebab that could pose a serious risk to their health. “Councils always take action to tackle poor or dangerous hygiene and improve conditions and see first-hand what shockingly can go on behind closed doors at rogue food premises. “Businesses have recently been prosecuted for being riddled with mice or cockroach infestations, rodent droppings on food and caught with a chef smoking when preparing food.” Mandatory display of food hygiene ratings is supported by the consumer organisation Which?, the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health and many environmental health officers. Last year Gordon Ramsay’s Maze restaurant in Mayfair, London, scored just two out of five after inspectors found cockroaches on the premises. Immediate steps were taken and Maze now scores top marks. The LGA released details of recent food safety breaches, including in Croydon where more than 100 food outlets failed to meet expected hygiene standards last year, including 22 on a single street. One of the largest fines ever levied for food hygiene offences was imposed on a company operating two Croydon 99p stores . It was fined £154,000 in November 2015 after admitting seven breaches of food safety and hygiene laws. Both shops were found to have large mouse infestations when Croydon council food and safety officers visited. Liverpool city council health inspectors found a mice infestation at a city centre branch of Costa Coffee, which was fined £13,200 in court in March. The business agreed to a voluntary closure and admitted three charges of breaching food safety and hygiene laws. Liverpool council has since awarded it a five-star hygiene rating after successfully dealing with the problem. ',?
'A fifth of small firms closed by winter storms are trading again More than 1,000 businesses across north-west England reopen after being damaged by storms Desmond and Eva Flooding in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in December. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA Press Association Related: Electricity firm retracts compensation pledge after Storm Desmond power cuts Around a fifth of small companies affected by the widespread floods have signalled that they are open for trading on a special online map, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government. Nearly 5,000 businesses across Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Northumberland were affected by storms Desmond and Eva, which wreaked havoc during December. Among them was Paul Tarry, the landlord of the Wagon and Horses pub in Lancaster, whose cellar flooded with around 14ft of water, forcing it to shut for three months until the end of February. The 59-year-old estimated the costs in damage and lost custom was more than £250,000. “We had bookings for 800 people over Christmas – we had to let all those people down,” he said. “People have been absolutely great since we reopened – we’ve had a number of people coming to have Christmas parties in March. We did not bother with the tree and crackers. “We couldn’t wait to reopen – people said ‘did you have a holiday?’ We have to say ‘no we did not not, it was damn hard work’.” Tarry said he was aware of six other pubs and restaurants nearby that had still not reopened. Another business that returned to trading was Calcaria Stoves, in Tadcaster – the village whose 250-year-old bridge was completely destroyed in December’s floods, leaving the popular tourist spot cut in half. The eco-friendly stove company had been flooded twice in the 10 months that it had been open but was able to get up and running again within three weeks. Related: Trying to stay afloat: schools face months of upheaval after UK floods Communities secretary Greg Clark said: “It is testament to the sheer hard work and remarkable spirit of company owners across Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Northumberland that just four months after devastating floods they are now back and trading once more. “We’re determined to stand behind flood-affected areas for the long-haul and have made millions of pounds available to help them get back on their feet – as the clean-up continues seeing businesses reopen helps communities return to as normal a life as possible. “So I would urge businesses across the area to register their details on our dedicated map – and show tourists and residents alike that they are open for business.” According to the Environment Agency , more than 20,000 properties were flooded as storms Desmond and Eva swept across the country and December became the wettest month on record.

'Services sector Tips should go to workers, not employers, says government report Charges on gratuities in restaurants, hotels and bars should be scrapped or limited, according to a review of tipping practices ‘Restaurant staff should get the tips, not the employers.’ Photograph: Lucy Young/REX/Shutterstock Sunday 1 May 2016 19.01 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 04.03 EDT Share on WhatsApp Tips in restaurants, hotels and bars should go to workers and not their employers, the government said in a report published on Monday. After an eight-month review of tipping practices, the government said charges imposed on staff tips by employers should be scrapped or limited. Service charges on customers’ bills should also be clear and voluntary, the proposals said. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, launched the investigation last August after some of Britain’s best-known restaurant chains were exposed for withholding some or all of the service charges from staff – often without customers’ knowledge. Unions accused businesses such as Pizza Express and Giraffe of abusing the 2009 voluntary code set up to stop tips being used by employers to meet the minimum wage. Pizza Express, which took 8% of tips paid on a card, and Giraffe, which charged 10%, have said they will stop doing so. Chains such as the Mexican street food outlet Wahaca and Jamie Oliver’s Jamie’s Italian have also deducted a percentage of waiters’ card sales to be shared with other workers, but other restaurants have used tips to pay for breakages, till shortfalls and customers failing to pay. The government is considering banning emplyer deductions from tips.

Limiting such deductions to the cost of processing credit card tips and dealing with the payment through payroll. Banning or restricting employers from charging waiting staff a percentage of their table sales during a shift. Encouraging properly managed “ troncs ” – arrangements for sharing tips administered by a staff member, not the employer. Publishing the report, Javid said: “We want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That’s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.” Related: How much should I tip? The etiquette of service charges and gratuities Javid said the government would decide whether to make changes by revamping the 2009 code or, to give the rules more weight, enshrining them in legislation. The Unite union, whose campaign helped expose restaurant chains’ treatment of tips , said the report was a “massive, rightful victory” and called on Javid to change the law instead of relying on the voluntary code. Dave Turnbull, Unite’s officer for the hospitality industry, said: “The problem has always been that tips paid on a credit card and service charges are deemed the property of the employer. Until staff are recognised as the lawful owners of their hard-earned tips with complete control over how they are shared out, rogue employers will continue to cream off staff tips.” The proposals also attempt to clear up confusion and dubious practices around service charges added to bills that often go to the employer and not staff. There is no legal requirement for any part of these optional payments to be paid to employees. The government said customers often did not understand the charges were at their discretion and that they deterred diners from leaving a tip on top. Businesses could be banned from adding a service charge or forced to make it clearer that the charge is discretionary. Cover charges imposed by the restaurant also need to be made clearer so consumers know what they will pay, the government said. ',?
'Millennial finance Tired, poor, huddled millennials of New York earn 20% less than prior generation Entering the workforce in the greatest economic downturn in living memory, millennials earn much less than Generation X and might never close the gap It isn’t love of coffee that has New York millennials with college education taking jobs as baristas. Photograph: Action Press/Rex/Shutterstock Monday 25 April 2016 23.30 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 26 April 2016 13.01 EDT Share on WhatsApp Scoff all you like at hoverboard hipsters and Brooklyn baristas: life is tough for millennials trying to chase down their American dream in New York City. The city’s millennials make about 20% less than the generation before them, according to a new report released by New York City comptroller Scott Stringer. Entering the workforce during the greatest economic downturn in living memory, millennials – despite attending college at much higher rate than Gen X – have been stuck in low-wage jobs and might never make up that 20% gap. The report defines millennials as those born between 1985 and 1996. “This generation is at a crossroads,” Stringer said. “They worked hard, got an education and then faced roadblocks to getting a good-paying job. It’s time for us to pay attention to the largest generation in New York City, and start to break down those barriers.” The public has been paying attention to millennials, but mostly the attention has been on the fact that they choose juice shots over alcohol or that they ride hoverboards while at work. Less attention has been paid to the fact that there is a reason why co-living spaces with month-to-month leases make sense for the generation that isn’t sure if it’s coming or going. It isn’t love of coffee that has millennials with college education taking jobs as baristas. “The percentage of young adults working in low-wage industries who have a bachelor’s degree grew from 23% to 33% between 2000 and 2014,” the report found. And while low-wage industries have hired more young people over the years, they have also lowered their wages. The report found that while hospitality and retail sectors created 91,000 new jobs for young people, wages in the two sectors fell by 16% from 2000 to 2014. The arts and entertainment sector, which is considered a mid-wage employer, hired 16,000 millennials during that same time – but their income fell by 26%. And while wages in finance went up by 14%, the jobs available to millennials dropped by 11,000. “Millennials were applying for jobs in the most difficult economic climate since the Great Depression and as a result, a growing number are now working in low-wage industries and earning less than their predecessors,” Stringer said. “This group of young people is confronting unique economic challenges that their parents did not have to face. Every generation is expected to do better than the last, but too many millennials are not getting a fair chance to make it in New York City.” This trend of being an underemployed millennial is also not unique to New York. A recent report released by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that for recent college graduates, aged between 21 and 24 years old, the underemployment rate was 12.6%, compared to 26.8% in 2007. Related: College-educated women earn $8,000 less a year than men as gap widens “A third of young high school graduates are underemployed and one in eight young college graduates is underemployed. Those are improvements from last year, but nowhere near the economy of 2000,” Teresa Kroeger , one of the authors of the EPI report’s authors, told the Guardian. The economy of 2000, by some standards, is when the economy has been at its best in the recent history. Not only are these millennials working jobs that do not require the college degrees they have spent years obtaining, but they are also burdened with debt. Those living in New York’s five boroughs owe about $14bn in student loans, according to Stringer’s office. “Nationwide, total student loan balances held by all borrowers under 30 years old increased at nearly a 10% annual rate between 2005 and 2014, reaching $369bn,” it said. Sorry, millennial Carrie Bradshaw wanna-bes, it’s student loan bills for you instead of those Gen X Manolo Blahniks and Louboutins. ',?
'Money and feminism Women have better chances of getting hired when competing against women A female candidate’s chances of being hired are statistically zero if she is the only woman in a pool of finalists, a recent report on job hiring practices found Having just one woman or minority candidate for a job ‘isn’t a true diversity effort’, one of the study’s authors said. Photograph: Alamy Tuesday 26 April 2016 16.52 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 26 April 2016 19.50 EDT Share on WhatsApp If you are a woman applying for a job, having another woman in the final candidate pool could significantly improve your chances by 50%, according to a recent report. “When there is only one woman, she does not stand a chance of being hired, but that changes dramatically when there is more than one,” the report’s authors wrote in the Harvard Business Review on Tuesday. “When there was only one woman or minority candidate in a pool of four finalists, their odds of being hired were statistically zero. But when we created a new status quo among the finalist candidates by adding just one more woman or minority candidate, the decision makers actually considered hiring a woman or minority candidate.” The likelihood that a woman would be hired. Photograph: Stefanie Johnson/Courtesy of University of Colorado The report was based on three different studies, conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business. In the first study, 144 undergraduate students were deciding between three job candidates – some of which had what the report’s authors called “stereotypically black names”. The study found that if the majority of finalists were white, participants tended to recommend a white candidate and if majority of finalists were black, they would recommend a black candidate. In the second study, 200 students made a similar decision, but this time based on gender. In the third study, the researchers looked at 598 finalists considered for jobs at a university – 174 of those finalists received job offers over a three-year period. The average hiring pool for this study was four finalists. While some might consider these candidate pools small, a typical corporate job listing receives 250 applications on average . Those resumes are then sorted either by software or a recruiting manager and are narrowed down to a pool of four to six finalists, who are then called in for an interview. The report was authored byStefanie K Johnson and David R Hekman, both assistant professors, and Elsa T Chan, a PhD candidate at the university. On 12 April, the national equal pay day, they presented their findings at the White House. Among the feedback they received was shock at the fact that one minority or female candidate in the finalist pool is not enough, according to Johnson. “So many companies, for such a long time, have been working to get a woman in the pool: ‘We have to get one woman in the pool. We have to get one minority in the pool.’ And that’s been [human resources] effort to at least get one minority candidate,” she explained “And what this paper says is that it’s not enough to include just one female or one minority candidate in the pool to make yourself feel better. It isn’t a true diversity effort.” The researchers themselves were surprised at how much the subjects in their studies fell in line with the status quo. “I was extremely shocked [by the findings],” Hekman told the Guardian.

'What one milk carton says about sustainability messaging around the world To be truly sustainable, companies must reconcile the different marketing messages they use around the world Milk bought in the UK tends to come in packaging with positive messages about the environment and combating climate change. Photograph: Alamy Supported by director of the Global Opportunity Network Wednesday 27 April 2016 00.00 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 27 April 2016 00.40 EDT Share on WhatsApp You might not realise it when you walk along the aisles of your local supermarket, but you are surrounded by marketing messages. These differ in every country. Buying milk in the UK? You’ll probably see messages about climate change and the environment. Go to China and the packaging is more likely to emphasise its origins and address consumer concern about food safety. These simple but fundamental differences, with in this case milk, illustrate how businesses adapt their marketing strategies depending on the market. They use whatever elements of sustainability consumers care most about in a given market. This was borne out by the findings of our Global Opportunity Report 2016 . In it we asked more than 5,500 business and public sector leaders worldwide which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) they think hold the best business potential in their region. Their answers showed differences across the world between the sustainability issues people care about. If we stay with the example of milk we can see what this means for companies and how they market their produce. In sub-Saharan Africa, the SDGs dealing with the social bits of sustainability ranked highest for business potential – this is what we would call the people market. Pinterest Advertisements for dairy in Africa focus on personal health, rather than environmental considerations. Photograph: Brookside Dairy Ltd For global dairy company Danone, which has acquired 40% of east Africa’s largest milk company Brookside Dairy Limited , this means promoting to people that consuming its product is doing them and their children good. As a result, milk packages in Africa focus on the nutritional value of milk. In Europe, where business leaders rate the SDG on climate change as a top driver for new business, companies are operating in what we would call a planet market. Here the term sustainability tends to be associated with environmental issues and organic production. Animal welfare is also an important requirement in organic production in the EU, which helps explain why the dairy company Arla’s milk cartons in this region feature animals and clear reference to their work reducing CO2 emissions. In Asia, we see the growth of what we would call the safety market – a series of food scandals has made consumers look for options that put safety first. In China, for example, people are increasingly concerned about the origin of their food, especially when it comes to feeding their children. Organic milk, with the emphasis on the quality of production and traceability of the product, is considered to be a safe product. Arla has said that it is working to rebuild credibility with consumers in the region by instituting safety measures as it introduces its product to this new market. ',?
'Pinterest Puppies as young as seven weeks old begin training. Photograph: Alamy Every day is different in this job. It totally varies. I spend a lot of time visiting guide dog puppies that are currently placed with volunteer walkers. I compile objectives tailored to each puppy to ensure they’re on the right track and making good progress. Sometimes we even do group walks, which is a really great chance for puppies to get used to being around other dogs. Do I have a favourite puppy? I’m not meant to but, if I’m honest, I like the ones that are a bit naughty as it’s more of a challenge, and then so rewarding seeing them go on to be a guide dog who will change the life of someone living with sight loss. I love the German shepherd breed in particular. Each pup has an individual temperament and character. I love seeing how their personalities develop over the year. Although they don’t live with me, my arrival to the homes of the volunteer puppy walkers normally causes great excitement from the pups, which is lovely to see. It also helps aid their adaptability to accept and work for other people, which in turn contributes to their training and beyond. Training the dogs to the highest standard is extremely important. We ensure that our training programmes are individually designed in order to meet the needs of the owner and the guide dog. Matching the correct dog with the correct owner takes skill and experience. The owner’s length of stride, height and lifestyle all contribute to the type of guide dog they will be matched with. Then there is four weeks of intensive training before the pair qualify as a guide dog partnership. There’s no one size fits all when it comes to puppy training. Each pup is individual and they all have different ways and degrees of learning. To be successful you need to set realistic guidelines from day one, keeping in mind the end goal; that one day these puppies will go on to help someone with sight loss. It may be cute for an eight-week-old puppy to jump at someone for a cuddle but it is not so good when that pup weighs a lot more and can cause injury or embarrassment. Related: Working with dinosaurs: the secret life of a paleontologist It can be tough to let go. At around 12 months most of our puppies go into full guide dog training and the volunteer puppy walker’s job is complete. It can be a difficult job to take the pup away from their puppy walker, so they can go on to full guide dog training. It’s important to be able to let go after the puppies have finished their training. But it’s incredibly rewarding. I wouldn’t have been here for so long if I didn’t see the amazing benefits. I’ve met owners who didn’t leave their house before they had a guide dog. Seeing the way guide dogs can transform lives is so rewarding. Guide dogs offer many people living with sight loss an incredible sense of confidence, independence and freedom – as well as being a trusted companion and loyal friend to their owner. Many people think it is the dog who makes decisions, such as when to cross the road, when in fact this responsibility lies with the owner. Our dogs are taught “intelligent disobedience”, which means they need to be confident enough to overrule a command if it is not safe to do so, such as if a car is coming. Experience with dogs is the most important thing for this career. It could be experience in any shape or form. So if you’re interested in becoming a guide dog puppy trainer, contact the Guide Dogs charity or other similar charities, and try to get some experience within those sectors. Looking for a job?

'Share on WhatsApp There are stories that we like to tell ourselves to account for large systemic imbalances in our society, myths that we employ to feel comfortable in our analysis of social problems. Melanin makes you violent is a stupid, strange fiction; it absolves society from ever confronting the prejudice that is inextricable from policies; it perpetuates legal segregation without ever admitting that segregation is deliberate; it masks our complicity in allowing the growth of the carceral state by suggesting it must always be so. On Wednesday, a new stud y by Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , Forward Together and Research Action Design put the lie to our self-serving fictions. The disproportionate criminalization of African Americans has served to reinforce segregation and income inequality over generations, and African American men are not its sole victims. The study found that on average families with an imprisoned relative paid $13,607 in court-related costs. In addition, one in five families who participated in the study reported that they had to take out a loan to cover these costs. One in five families were unable to afford housing expenses due to the loss of income from their loved one’s incarceration. Two out of three families had difficulty meeting basic needs as a result of their loved one’s conviction and incarceration. 83% of family members primarily responsible for these costs were women. There are over 2.2 million Americans currently in the prison system, accounting for 25% of the world’s prison population, the highest of the industrialized nations. It is estimated that 58% of the nation’s incarcerated are black and Latino men . Black families are and have always been imperiled by aggressive criminal justice policies and demonized for their effects; the disintegration of black families then blocks the formerly incarcerated from accessing basic necessities for survival. That hardship only perpetuates systemic income inequality, and this hardship is shouldered disproportionately by black women. In the latest cover story by Ta-Nehisi Coates, out in the October issue of the Atlantic, The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration , Coates makes a case that a dystopian fairy tale about African-American family structures has accompanied the rapid rate of incarceration of African Americans as far back as 1965. At the height of the civil rights movement, then Assistant Labor Secretary Daniel Patrick Moynihan released The Negro Family , a report intended to address black urban poverty yet intentionally omitted tangible policy recommendations. Instead, it built the base of the family-centered magic fix rhetoric ubiquitous in our ongoing discussions and implementation of vast urban public policy from housing, schools and finally, the unprecedented rise of mass incarceration that disproportionately affects poor black families. The Moynihan narrative is one of the reasons why the government created racist, classist policies that incentivized the dissolution (or non-formation) of black families, then problematized black people for not having them. In an interview, Joyce Ladner – a student at Washington University in 1964 –recalled her experiences working as a research assistant for a National Institute of Health funded study that focused on the lives of women and girls in public housing: “The welfare department had a rule that no able bodied man could be in the house if a woman received aid for dependent children.” Moynihan’s myth that African-Americans are incapable of building and maintaining family structures was so persuasive that, to this day, it’s used to justify the warehousing of people from derelict and underserved communities. It is also employed to justify moves to divest from urban centers that would produce opportunities for the people of ‘poor moral character’, who only have ‘poor moral character’ because they were born poor. The zeal in which society sought to address violence and poverty pervasive in urban black communities by actively destroying families is evidenced by state and federal laws creating greater punitive measures for the incarcerated from New York State’s Rockefeller drug laws of to the Clinton Administration’s 1994 Crime Bill compounded by layers of rules within the bail bond system that ultimately fuels recidivism. As the Black Lives Matters movement has striven to show, the absence of black men fills many of our institutional origin stories, but the problem isn’t our insufficient commitment to traditional family structures. The idea that black people fill our prisons because they are inherently violent and have flawed family structures has never been true. It is time to acknowledge the deliberate destruction of our family structures and stop peddling harmful, racist myths. ',?
'Downward mobility What does California’s new minimum wage buy? A long commute and a room California will be the first state to adopt a $15 minimum wage, but for residents exiled to the Bay Area’s fringes by impossible rents, it may not make a difference San Francisco has turned into a commuter city as a result of rents that are impossible for low-income workers to afford. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Saturday 2 April 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Saturday 2 April 2016 11.42 EDT Share on WhatsApp Spending more than three hours in a car each day is not unusual for Daniel Gretz. Gretz works as a security guard in Milpitas, which is in the southern part of California’s Bay Area. Each morning, he gets in the car and drives about 97 miles up Route 101 from Greenfield where he lives with his brother’s family. Gretz had grown up in nearby Cupertino and has over the years seen housing and rental prices sky rocket. “There are more and more people moving outside the Bay and then commuting to work,” says Gretz. Five years ago, when he first moved to Greenfield, his commute was “an hour and 15 minutes max. Now, on a good day, it’s an hour 45 minutes. On Friday, I leave work at 4:30 and not get home until 7 o’clock.” Trying to survive on hourly pay of $15 an hour, Gretz feels he has no choice but to make the daily trek up and down the 101. Moving closer to Milpitas and San Jose would mean renting a place that would swallow up the majority of his monthly paycheck. As California becomes the first state to approve a proposal for $15 minimum wage, the question becomes: is $15 an hour enough? On Monday, Governor Jerry Brown will sign a bill that will gradually increase California’s minimum wage over the next six years until it reaches $15 an hour by 2022 . Thanks to a 2014 ballot initiative , San Francisco will have a $15 minimum wage by July 2018. And while $15 an hour will benefit many of California’s low-wage workers, in the Bay Area it is barely enough to live on. Stagnant wages have not kept up with the rents, which have gone up by more than 10% each year . In search of lower rents, Bay Area residents have moved further away from their jobs – often traveling from one Bay Area city to another for work. According to the US census, for most workers in the Bay Area their commute to work is about 30 minutes long . For those earning $15 and less, however, it can sometimes be as long as one to two hours each way. The Bay Area consists of 101 cities, nine counties and spans about 7,000 square miles. It is home to more than seven million people. To picture how sprawling the Bay Area is, consider this: New York City – home to more than eight million people – is just 304.6 square miles. The Bay Area is about 23 times as large. Pinterest Bay Area commuters like Carlos Gutierrez often face overcrowded trains, travel delays and other inconveniences.

The space belongs to Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth (Homey), a community organization focused on helping at-risk youth. Near the staircase on the second floor is a whiteboard. On it, written in red marker is: “Moving day sux.” The organization renting the space above Homey was recently evicted and had just moved out, says Carlos Gutierrez, director of operations of Homey, when asked about the note. Homey was able to extend its lease, but its rent has almost doubled. Most of the people working at Homey have grown up in the Mission, but in recent years have had to move to places like Oakland and Stockton after being either evicted or having their rents hiked too far. A drive from Stockton to San Francisco is about two hours each way. “People born in San Francisco can’t afford to live in San Francisco,” says Gutierrez, 36, who has moved to Oakland with his teenage son. As a result, he says, San Francisco has become a commuter city. San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose – all cities in the Bay Area – are among the 10 most expensive cities to rent a one-bedroom apartment, according to Zumper , a startup that connects people with houses and apartments for rent. In December, median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco was $3,500, highest in the nation. At $2,190, Oakland was the fourth most expensive city and San Jose was sixth, with median rents for one-bedroom apartments reaching $2,130. In Oakland, where Gutierrez lives, the rent for one-bedroom apartments increased by 19% in 2015 . Rent of two-bedroom apartments increased by 13.3%, reaching $2,550. In the US, affordable housing is defined as housing that costs about 30% of one’s monthly take home pay. For a $2,190 one-bedroom apartment to be affordable, one would have to make about $7,300 a month, which is equivalent to about $87,600. The annual salary for someone earning $15 an hour? A little more than $31,200. Working at Homey, Gutierrez earns between $30,000 and $35,000 a year. His rent in Oakland is $1,200. After taxes, his rent is more than half of his take-home pay, he says. His daily train rides to and from work add up as well. He also has more than $40,000 in student loans. Despite all that, he can’t imagine leaving the San Francisco area and the community that he has grown up in and cares about. ',?
'Global development professionals network Is more funding the answer to Pakistan’s struggling microfinance sector? Microfinance is a booming industry in neighbouring India and Bangladesh, but has had a slower rise in Pakistan An estimated 20.7 million people in Pakistan want to take out a microloan, but only 3.7 million receive them Photograph: Anjum Naveed/AP Nishat Ahmed Thursday 25 February 2016 08.33 EST Last modified on Wednesday 16 March 2016 13.08 EDT Share on WhatsApp There is a growing desire within Pakistan to expand its microfinance sector and innovate. Since the 1990s, however, the country’s attempts to blend commercial and development models (pdf) to tackle poverty, the gender gap and unemployment have struggled against a backdrop of financial and political instability. From July this year the newly established Pakistan Microfinance Investment Company (PMIC) aims to prove the microfinance sceptics wrong and begin to tackle some of the country’s entrenched social problems. Related: 11 ways to close the gender gap in financial inclusion Set up in partnership with the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID) and the German development bank KFW , it will be the world’s first national level intermediary organisation that will help mobilise funds from investors specifically for microfinance institutions. According to Yasir Ashfaq, group head of financial services at PPAF, one of its main objectives will be to ensure the organisations it supports channel capital to a variety of sectors in Pakistan’s economy, from crop production, to livestock, enterprises and handicrafts. Ultimately, through the organisation’s investment, microfinance providers will be able to offer loans with lower interest rates to more Pakistanis. The PMIC was set up after the finance ministry revealed that Pakistan’s microfinance needs will grow significantly by 2018. PPAF’s estimates 20.7 million people want to take out a microloan but only 3.7 million receive them. It is this large supply and demand gap that the investment company aims to fill. Ashfaq says: “The donors or previously subsidised funds [for microfinancers] are no longer available and the commercial banks are not willing to offer funds to microfinance institutions without guarantees. In order to fill this gap and serve more people additional funding is required.” DfID, PPAF and KFW will provide the initial 6bn Pakistani rupees (£41m) the PMIC hopes to distribute, with other investors joining at a later stage, says Ashfaq. Related: The microfinance delusion: who really wins? However, these changes to Pakistan’s microfinance sector are coming on the back of criticism of the sector. Faraz Khan, co-founder of social enterprise and equity development programme Seed Ventures , believes that the policymakers developing a strategy for microfinance in Pakistan have yet to support the full potential of small businesses. “These enterprises can’t scale up not only because of the lack of access to finance but also because they are unable to reach specialist training or programmes which can help their businesses to grow or get government support, subsidies or energy rates,” he says. Brac , an NGO which started working in Pakistan in 2007, views the regulatory environment as supportive to the microfinance sector, but its director for microfinance, Shameran Abed, believes this is mainly for microfinance institutions which want to become regulated banks. He says: “This is what we’ve seen happen to some of the most established players in the microfinance market. Regulations are less supportive of more informal entities such as NGOs promoting financial inclusion. Most NGOs have now become regulated microfinance banks [to get support].” Abed believes, however, the latest government regulations for non-banking microfinance institutions are a good start and will allow those that do not want to become microfinance banks to operate under a different legal arrangement. Related: How to transform the lives of ultra-poor women: new evidence from Brac in Bangladesh “This [new investment company] can help to promote financial inclusion if it is willing to provide long-term capital to microfinance institutions, especially ones that show a real commitment to serving the more remote areas. The central bank should also consider setting up a soft loan facility for microfinance institutions that are willing to go into rural areas.” According to Brac one of the biggest challenges to the sector in Pakistan is expansion into underserved parts of the country like rural Sindh and Baluchistan where branches can not get enough borrowers, experienced staff are hard to come by, and workers from other areas are reluctant to relocate. However, scaling up to make microloans available to more people will be expensive. Ashfaq says: “The Microfinance Growth Strategy 2020 forecasts that the sector would require additional equity, debt and deposits of up to US$3bn [£2.1bn] to reach up to 10 million borrowers.” The country had 3.1 million active borrowers in 2014. As well as these stumbling blocks, microfinance initiatives in Pakistan are also subject to the same criticism they have encountered globally. The overhead costs of microfinance remains high and risky, and potentially fruitful projects are often unlikely to be invested in as most projects are selected because investors expect to get 90% of their money back if not more. Related: Bangladesh Bank makes financial inclusion for street kids child’s play It is also uncertain if these initiatives are able to offer an escape from poverty as financed projects often fall short of becoming and remaining profitable in the long run. Adeel Malik, global fellow in the Economies of Muslim Societies at Oxford University’s Department of International Development highlights that the microfinance sector does not operate in a vacuum, saying it is important to recognise that microfinance operates in a larger political economy context that is defined by profound structural inequalities which are expanding. “Although feudal structures are weakening, land continues to remain an important economic and political asset in Pakistan,” says Malik, explaining that poverty and illiteracy are most rife in regions with high levels of land inequality. “Microfinance may restore some individuals from the depths of poverty but it’s unclear if it can offer a permanent avenue of economic and social mobility.” This article was amended on 26 February 2016. An earlier version said that Pakistan’s microfinance sector would require additional equity, debt and deposits of up to US$300m [£215m] to reach up to 10 million borrowers. The sector actually would require US$3bn. ',?

Photograph: Mario Anzuoni / Reuters/REUTERS Monday 2 May 2016 12.51 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 12.58 EDT Share on WhatsApp More coffee, please! A Chicago woman is suing Starbucks for allegedly serving her too much ice and too little caffeine in its cold beverages. With summer on the horizon and iced drinks coming back into season, Starbucks is being accused of short-changing its coffee lovers. “A Starbucks customer who orders a Venti cold drink receives only 14 fluid ounces of that drink – just over half the advertised amount, and just over half the amount for which they are paying,” states the 29-page-long complaint filed by customer Stacey Pincus, the lead plaintiff in the case, filed in northern Illinois federal court on Wednesday, according to Courthouse News Service . “In the iced coffee example, a Starbucks customer who orders and pays for a Venti iced coffee, expecting to receive 24 fluid ounces of iced coffee based on Starbucks’ advertisement and marketing, will instead receive only about 14 fluid ounces of iced coffee.” Starbucks’ cold beverages come in four different sizes: tall (12oz), grande (16oz), venti (24oz) and trenta (30oz). Hot beverages are only served in the first three sizes. “In essence, Starbucks is advertising the size of its cold drink cups on its menu, rather than the amount of fluid a customer will receive when they purchase a cold drink – and deceiving its customers in the process,” states the lawsuit. Related: What war on Christmas? Starbucks holiday sales lead to record revenue Pincus’s complaint also takes issue with the company’s pricing system, which includes higher prices for cold drinks. Since hot drinks do not include ice and cost less, she argues, Starbucks is making more money off of customers buying iced drinks. Starbucks believes that the lawsuit is without merit. “Our customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any ‘iced’ beverage.

'Share on WhatsApp As the European Union begins to disintegrate, who can provide the leadership to save it? German chancellor Angela Merkel is widely credited with finally answering Henry Kissinger’s famous question about the Western alliance: “What is the phone number for Europe?” But if Europe’s phone number has a German dialling code, it goes through to an automated answer: “Nein zu Allem.” This phrase – “No to everything” – is how Mario Draghi , the European Central Bank president, recently described the standard German response to all economic initiatives aimed at strengthening Europe. A classic case was Merkel’s veto of a proposal by Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi to fund refugee programmes in Europe, North Africa, and Turkey through an issue of EU bonds, an efficient and low-cost idea also advanced by leading financiers such as George Soros . Merkel’s high-handed refusal even to consider broader European interests if these threaten her domestic popularity has become a recurring nightmare for other EU leaders. This refusal underpins not only her economic and immigration policies, but also her bullying of Greece, her support for coal subsidies, her backing of German carmakers over diesel emissions , her kowtowing to Turkey on press freedom, and her mismanagement of the Minsk agreement in Ukraine. In short, Merkel has done more to damage the EU than any living politician, while constantly proclaiming her passion for “the European project”. But where can a Europe disillusioned with German leadership now turn? The obvious candidates will not or cannot take on the role: Britain has excluded itself; France is paralysed until next year’s presidential election and possibly beyond; and Spain cannot even form a government. That leaves Italy, a country that, having dominated Europe’s politics and culture for most of its history, is now treated as “peripheral”. But Italy is resuming its historic role as a source of Europe’s best ideas and leadership in politics, and also, most surprisingly, in economics. Draghi’s transformation of the ECB into the world’s most creative and proactive central bank is the clearest example of this. The enormous programme of quantitative easing that Draghi pushed through, against German opposition, has saved the euro by circumventing the Maastricht Treaty’s rules against monetising or mutualising government debts. Last month, Draghi became the first central banker to take seriously the idea of helicopter money – the direct distribution of newly created money from the central bank to eurozone residents. Germany’s leaders have reacted furiously and are now subjecting Draghi to nationalistic personal attacks . Less visibly, Italy has also led a quiet rebellion against the pre-Keynesian economics of the German government and the European commission. In EU councils and again at this month’s International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, DC, Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister, presented the case for fiscal stimulus more strongly and coherently than any other EU leader. More important, Padoan has started to implement fiscal stimulus by cutting taxes and maintaining public spending plans, in defiance of German and EU commission demands to tighten his budget. As a result, consumer and business confidence in Italy have rebounded to the highest level in 15 years, credit conditions have improved, and Italy is the only G7 country expected by the IMF to grow faster in 2016 than 2015 (albeit still at an inadequate 1% rate). Padoan has more recently created an imaginative public-private partnership to finance a desperately needed recapitalization of Italy’s banks. And he has launched his initiative without waiting for approval from ECB and EU officials, who blocked an earlier “bad bank” plan under German pressure. Financial markets immediately rewarded Italy for its defiance, with the share price of the country’s biggest bank, Unicredit, jumping by 25% in three days. Italy’s increasingly assertive resistance to German economic dogmas may not be surprising: The country has suffered from almost continuous recession since joining the euro. Moreover, Padoan, who was formerly the OECD’s chief economist, is the only G-7 finance minister with professional economics training. He understands better than anyone that misguided fiscal and monetary policies have been the underlying cause of Europe’s economic underperformance, and are largely responsible for the political tensions threatening to destroy the EU. The renaissance of Italian self-confidence and leadership can also be observed in domestic and international politics. Renzi was the only European leader to increase his party’s vote share in the 2014 European Parliament election, and his dominance of Italian politics has since grown. While populist politics now threatens Germany , France, Spain, and Britain, Italy has turned its back on Silvio Berlusconi, and Renzi has squeezed support for the Northern League and the Five Star Movement. As a result, Italy has started implementing labour, pension, and administrative reforms that were unthinkable in the past. In foreign affairs, too, Italy has become more assertive. The Italian foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, is collaborating with his predecessor, Federica Mogherini, now the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, to create more pragmatic and effective European policies on Libya and the refugee crisis. Most significantly, Italy is leading an effort to repair relations with Russia after the Ukraine confrontation and to strengthen cooperation over Syria. This campaign appears to be bearing fruit with a gradual lifting of EU sanctions against Russia, starting this summer. Given the failures of German leadership in Europe and the political vacuum elsewhere in the EU, Italy’s decision to raise its profile is surely right. As Renzi put it in a recent interview : “After two years listening, now I speak.” It remains to be seen whether Italy can assemble a coalition of economically progressive and politically pragmatic countries to overcome German conservatism and dogmatism. But one way or another, Europe’s political economy will have to adapt to the new type of global capitalism evolving out of the 2008 crisis. With luck, a new breed of wily and agile Italian leaders will out-manoeuvre the blundering German dinosaurs, whose outdated rules and doctrines are leading the EU toward extinction. ',?
'Economics viewpoint Europe’s liberal illusions shatter as Greek tragedy plays on Voters across Europe have got the message from the way in which Greece’s opposition to austerity was crushed Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is hoping he can force Europe’s leaders to offer him a better deal. Photograph: Alexandros Vlachos/EPA Sunday 1 May 2016 06.46 EDT Last modified on Sunday 1 May 2016 17.00 EDT Greece is running out of money. The government in Athens is raiding the budgets of the health service and public utilities to pay salaries and pensions. Without fresh financial support it will struggle to make a debt payment due in July. No, this is not a piece from the summer of 2015 reprinted by mistake. Greece , after a spell out of the limelight, is back. Another summer of threats, brinkmanship and all-night summits looms. The problem is a relatively simple one. Greece is bridling at the unrealistic demands of the European commission and the International Monetary Fund to agree to fresh austerity measures when, as the IMF itself accepts, hospitals are running out of syringes and buses don’t run because of a lack of spare parts. Athens has already pushed through a package of austerity measures worth €5.4bn (£4.23bn) as the price of receiving an €86bn bailout agreed at the culmination of last summer’s protracted crisis and expected the deal to be finalised last October. Disbursements of the loan have been held up, however, because neither the commission or the IMF believe that Greece will make the promised savings. So they are demanding that Alexis Tsipras’s government legislate for additional “contingency measures” worth €3.6bn to be triggered in the event that Greece fails to meet its fiscal targets. This is almost inevitable, given that the target is for the country to run a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of gross domestic product by 2018 and in every year thereafter. This means that once Greece’s debt payments are excluded, tax receipts have to exceed public spending by 3.5% of GDP. The exceptionally onerous terms are supposed to whittle away Greece’s debt mountain, currently just shy of 200% of GDP. If this all sounds like Alice in Wonderland economics, then that’s because it is. Greece is being set budgetary targets that the IMF knows are unrealistic and is being set up to fail. It will then be punished further for being unable to do what was impossible in the first place. Predictably enough, the government in Athens is not especially taken with this idea. It has described the idea as outlandish and unconstitutional, but is in a weak position because it desperately needs the bailout loan and threw away its only real bargaining chip last year by making it clear that it would stay in the single currency whatever the price. So Tsipras is doing what he did last year. He is playing for time, hopeful that by hanging tough and threatening another summer of chaos he can force Europe’s leaders to offer him a better deal - less onerous deficit reduction measures coupled with a decent slug of debt relief. For the time being though, the matter is being handled by the eurozone’s finance ministers, who want their full pound of flesh. The mood is especially unyielding in Germany, where Angela Merkel’s popularity has suffered as a result of her open door policy toward refugees. Faced with growing hostility, she has concluded that this is not the time to show any signs of weakness. She has sought to mollify German voters by giving her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, a free hand to ratchet up his criticism of the stimulus policies Mario Draghi is pursuing at the European Central Bank, and by insisting that there should be no debt relief for Greece until Tsipras has done everything demanded of him. Merkel must pray that the lid can be kept on Greece until after 23 June, because it is hard to see how a repeat of last summer’s argy-bargy would help keep Britain inside the EU - rather more important to Germany in the long term than a few billion euros of debt relief. The reason is that David Cameron can only win his referendum by securing the votes of non-Conservative supporters , for some of whom the handling of Greece exemplifies everything that is wrong with the EU - its lack of democracy, hyper-conservative economic agenda and insistence that the single currency is a great success when in fact it has proved to be a colossal failure. Greece received the first of its three bailouts six years ago, when the terms were negotiated in the weekend following Britain’s general election. Gordon Brown was on his way out, but the then chancellor Alistair Darling went to Brussels to discuss the deal with fellow EU finance ministers. Since then, there have changes of government in all the big EU countries bar Germany , and most of the smaller ones as well. Voters showed their unhappiness by getting rid of the centre-right in France and the centre-left in Spain. They waved goodbye to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Mark Rutte in the Netherlands. It has been all change at local level, but no change in Brussels and Frankfurt, where the officials responsible for the eurozone’s bone-headed policies carry on regardless. Voters across Europe have got the message from the way Greece’s opposition to austerity was crushed - you can vote for whoever you like, but it won’t make any difference. The revolt against the status quo explains why Spain can’t form a government , the two parties that have dominated Irish politics since independence could barely muster more than 50% of the vote in the recent election , the runoff for president in Austria is between the greens and the far right and Marine Le Pen has support in France. To be sure, this is not a phenomenon exclusive to the eurozone. There is marked hostility to the US political establishment, and it is clear that many voters in the UK simply do not believe the government’s warnings about the economic risks of Brexit. The situation in the eurozone is worse, however, in part because the democratic deficit is so marked, in part because economic performance has been woeful and in part because there has been a dogged insistence on continuing with policies that have been both ineffective and unpopular. As Dan Atkinson and I argue in our forthcoming book about the failure of the single currency,* Greece was the point where progressive illusions were shattered. Until last summer it was just about possible to believe in a cuddly European polity dedicated to higher living standards, full employment and more generous welfare states. Then a gun was held to Greece’s head. Tsipras was faced with a choice. Ignore what the people want or see your banks go bust. This in a country which had seen the economy shrink by a quarter in five years. Difficult to spot what was awfully progressive about sucking spending power from an economy woefully short of demand. Then or now. *Europe isn’t working, by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, Yale University Press ',?
'Tax avoidance Trump and Clinton share Delaware tax ’loophole’ address with 285,000 firms 1209 North Orange Street in Wilmington is a nondescript two-storey building yet is home to Apple, American Airlines, Walmart and presidential candidates Eight days after stepping down as secretary of state in 2013, Hillary Clinton set up ZFS Holdings at CTC’s offices in Wilmington. A spokesman said it was to manage her book and speaking income. Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP Monday 25 April 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 25 April 2016 12.27 EDT Share on WhatsApp There aren’t many things upon which Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree, especially as they court very different Delaware voters ahead of a primary on Tuesday. But the candidates for president share an affinity for the same nondescript two-storey office building in Wilmington. A building that has become famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax through the so-called “Delaware loophole”. The receptionist at 1209 North Orange Street isn’t surprised that a journalist has turned up unannounced on a sunny weekday afternoon. “You know I can’t speak to you,” she says. A yellow post-it note on her computer screen reads “MEDIA: Chuck Miller” with the phone number of the company’s director of corporate communications. Miller can’t answer many questions either, except to say that the company does not advise clients on their tax affairs. The Guardian is not the first media organisation to turn up at the offices of Corporation Trust Centre, and it’s unlikely to be the last. Related: Forget Panama: it’s easier to hide your money in the US than almost anywhere This squat, yellow brick office building just north of Wilmington’s rundown downtown is the registered address of more than 285,000 companies. That’s more than any other known address in the world, and 15 times more than the 18,000 registered in Ugland House, a five-storey building in the Cayman Islands that Barack Obama called “either the biggest building in the world, or the biggest tax scam on record”. Officially, 1209 North Orange is home to Apple, American Airlines, Coca-Cola , Walmart and dozens of other companies in the Fortune 500 list of America’s biggest companies. Being registered in Delaware lets companies take advantage of strict corporate secrecy rules, business-friendly courts and the “Delaware loophole”, which can allow companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of the state. The loophole is said to have cost other states more than $9bn in lost taxes over the past decade and led to Delaware to be described as “one of the world’s biggest havens for tax avoidance and evasion”. But it’s not just big corporations that have chosen to make 1209 North Orange their official home. Both the leading candidates for president – Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump – have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why. Clinton, who has repeatedly promised that as president she will crack down on “outrageous tax havens and loopholes that super-rich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere”, collected more than $16m in public speaking fees and book royalties in 2014 through the doors of 1209, according to the Clintons’ tax return . Just eight days after stepping down as secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton registered ZFS Holdings LLC at CTC’s offices. Bill Clinton set up WJC LLC, a vehicle to collect his consultation fees, at the same address in 2008. A spokesman for Clinton said: “ZFS was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.” The Clintons’ companies share the office with several of Trump’s companies. They include Trump International Management Corp and several companies that form part of Hudson Waterfront Associates, a Trump partnership to develop more than $1bn worth of luxury condos on the west side of Manhattan. Of the 515 companies on Trump’s official Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing, 378 are registered in Delaware, he revealed, after being questioned by the Guardian about why so many of his New York-based companies are incorporated in Delaware . He said he asked his staff to find out how many entities he has in Delaware. “I figured they’d maybe say two or three, right?” Trump said at a rally in Harrington, Delaware, on Friday. “We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware, meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks. I don’t feel at all guilty, OK?” ',?
'Share on WhatsApp All is calm. All is still. Share prices are going up. Oil prices are rising. China has stabilised. The eurozone is over the worst. After a panicky start to 2016, investors have decided that things aren’t so bad after all. Put your ear to the ground though, and it is possible to hear the blades whirring. Far away, preparations are being made for helicopter drops of money onto the global economy. With due honour to one of Humphrey Bogart’s many great lines from Casablanca: “Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon.” But isn’t it true that action by Beijing has boosted activity in China, helping to push oil prices back above $40 a barrel? Has Mario Draghi not announced a fresh stimulus package from the European Central Bank designed to remove the threat of deflation? Are hundreds of thousands of jobs not being created in the US each month? In each case, the answer is yes. China’s economy appears to have bottomed out. Fears of a $20 oil price have receded. Prices have stopped falling in the eurozone. Employment growth has continued in the US. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting growth in the global economy of just over 3% this year – nothing spectacular, but not a disaster either. Don’t be fooled. China’s growth is the result of a surge in investment and the strongest credit growth in almost two years. There has been a return to a model that burdened the country with excess manufacturing capacity, a property bubble and a rising number of non-performing loans. The economy has been stabilised, but at a cost. The upward trend in oil prices also looks brittle. The fundamentals of the market - supply continues to exceed demand - have not changed. Then there’s the US. Here there are two problems – one glaringly apparent, the other lurking in the shadows. The overt weakness is that real incomes continue to be squeezed, despite the fall in unemployment. Americans are finding that wages are barely keeping pace with prices, and that the amount left over for discretionary spending is being eaten into by higher rents and medical bills. For a while, consumer spending was kept going because rock-bottom interest rates allowed auto dealers to offer tempting terms to those of limited means wanting to buy a new car or truck. In an echo of the subprime real estate crisis, vehicle sales are now falling. The hidden problem has been highlighted by Andrew Lapthorne of the French bank Société Générale. Companies have exploited the Federal Reserve’s low interest-rate regime to load up on debt they don’t actually need. “The proceeds of this debt raising are then largely reinvested back into the equity market via M&A or share buybacks in an attempt to boost share prices in the absence of actual demand,” Lapthorne says. “The effect on US non-financial balance sheets is now starting to look devastating.” He adds that the trigger for a US corporate debt crisis would be falling share prices, something that might easily be caused by the Fed increasing interest rates. . So that’s China and the US. How are the other two members of the “big four” – the eurozone and Japan – faring? The answer is not so well. Europe’s big problem, over and above the fact that the euro was a disastrously flawed concept, is that the banking system is not fit for purpose. As the IMF noted last week, a third of eurozone banks have no prospect of being profitable without urgent and meaningful reform. That requires two things: to reduce the number of banks and to do something about the €900bn (£715bn) of bad loans sitting on their books at the end of 2014. There is no immediate prospect of either happening, which makes it much harder for Draghi to get any traction with his stimulus package. The plan is that negative interest rates and quantitative easing will increase the incentives for eurozone commercial banks to lend more. The banking system, however, is badly impaired and the normal channels for creating credit are blocked. The same applies to Japan, where the financial markets have responded badly to the announcement of negative interest rates earlier this year. As in Europe, the idea was that the banks would lend more if they were penalised by negative interest rates for hoarding money. Higher lending would lead to higher levels of investment and consumption, which would in turn feed through into higher prices. The plan has not worked. There has been little impact on interest rates, banks have not increased their lending and the yen has risen on the foreign exchanges - the opposite of what was planned - because investors fear that the Bank of Japan is fast running out of ammunition. They have a point. Central banks, of course, swear blind that they are fully in control and that there is nothing to worry about. Perhaps not, but something doesn’t smell right. The fact that economists at Deutsche Bank published a helpful cut-out-and-keep guide to helicopter money last week is a straw in the wind. As the Deutsche research makes clear, the most basic variant of helicopter money involves a central bank creating money so that it can be handed to the finance ministry to spend on tax cuts or higher public spending. There are two differences with QE. The cash goes directly to firms and individuals rather than being channeled through banks, and there is no intention of the central bank ever getting it back. It will take some time to get the helicopters into the air. Central banks can muddle through for the rest of this year, beefing up their QE programmes and driving interest rates deeper into negative territory. The underlying softness of the global economy, however, means that it is quite easy to envisage a downturn in 2017, the 10th anniversary of the start of the financial crisis. In those circumstances, the unconventional would quickly become conventional, as it did after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The only question would be which central bank would move first. Hardline resistance from Germany means it certainly would not be the ECB, although the case for helicopter money in the eurozone is strong. Instead, it would be a toss up between the Fed, which is normally prepared to experiment with something different if the situation is desperate enough, or the Bank of Japan, where – as the Deutsche research reminds us – helicopter money was used successfully in the 1930s to help the country escape the Great Depression with far less damage than to other western nations. So give it a few months then listen hard. The choppers are coming. ',?
'TTIP What is TTIP and why should we be angry about it? The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership may sound boring, but it could affect everything from your income to the food you eat and the state of the NHS. Here is a beginners’ guide to the controversial trade deal Anti-TTIP graffiti in Brussels, Belgium. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters Monday 3 August 2015 13.15 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 07.23 EDT Share on WhatsApp “Sometimes,” says a character in David Foster Wallace’s novel The Pale King , “what’s important is dull. Sometimes it’s work. Sometimes the important things aren’t works of art for your entertainment.” It is worth bearing that in mind as we consider TTIP , the most boring thing we’re supposed to get angry about since – ooh … was it PFI schemes that nobbled hospitals, eviscerated schools and left Britain £222bn in debt? Or was it the asymmetrical constitutional ramifications inherent in the West Lothian question? Or George Osborne’s incomprehensible pension changes involving auto-enrolment annuities, tax wrappers, pots and draw-downs? Christine Lagarde’s last press conference about the Greek debt crisis ? Maybe it was your last mobile phone bill. Add up the boredom you experienced on each of those occasions, multiply the result by the international coefficient of tedium (which, as you know, is 27.5) and that’s how bored the international trade deal known as TTIP will make you. The Guardian’s expert on obfuscation by bureaucratese and acronym, Steven Poole, recently argued that TTIP could be a conspiracy to pull some very thick wool over our eyes. We live in an age when we’re so accustomed to being entertained that we haven’t the temperament to do the difficult work of penetrating the wool of boring. So we’re going to take that wool, roll it into a ball and leave it for the cat to play with. No, don’t look at the cat. Look at me. Focus. So, what is TTIP? Pinterest Ignacio Garcia Bercero (left), the EU chief negotiator for TTIP, and his US counterpart Dan Mullaney. Photograph: Thierry Charlier/AFP/Getty Images Remember when acronyms starting with two TTs were lovely things such as TTFN (ta-ta for now)? TTIP isn’t like that. It stands for Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Last month, the European parliament voted to allow the European commission to continue negotiations with the United States to create the world’s largest free-trade zone, which is what TTIP is all about. Pinterest Still confused? Watch our short video explainer on the TTIP Conservative trade spokesman Emma McClarkin said : “I welcome the fact that, following weeks of parliamentary ping-pong and attempts by socialist and protectionist MEPs to derail the process, we finally have a clear backing for TTIP.” Right, stop thinking how much fun parliamentary ping-pong sounds, particularly if a cat joins in. What McClarkin is looking forward to is greater regulatory harmonisation and a consequent boost for business, some of it, incredibly, British. Today, for instance, the US and EU have different regulations testing the safety of cars, drugs and soft furnishings. That imposes costs on transatlantic exporters of cars, drugs and soft furnishings – especially, you would think, on exporters of upholstery for drug dealers’ cars. One possible consequence of harmonisation could be a boost for British car exports. Imagine: one day Americans will be driving trim little Nissans made in Sunderland rather than ludicrous Hummers concocted in the bowels of hell. There are other projected benefits. US ambassador to the EU Anthony L Gardner argues that TTIP is, if you’ll pardon the expression, geopolitically pertinent, and that it would “provide an economic equivalent to Nato” that would settle “the rules of world trade before others do it for us” . Think about it this way: right now, Vladimir Putin can, if he chooses, strip to the waist for a photo op in which he turns off the gas pipe from Russia to Europe. That’s not good enough. Instead of being dependent on nasty Russian gas and oil, then, as a result of TTIP, the EU might become dependent on lovely American and Canadian gas and oil. That’s one reason behind the EU’s call for a dedicated chapter in TTIP on energy and raw materials. Instead of Russia isolating the EU, the EU could isolate Russia. Sweet. We have been invited to pronounce TTIP “tea tip”. Don’t these knuckleheads have any sense of history? The world’s most famous tea tip was in Boston in 1773, and that resulted in the marvellous era of transatlantic cooperation known as the American War of Independence. TTIP is not to be confused with TPP, which is the Trans-Pacific Partnership , involving 12 countries including the US, Australia and Brunei, and which, like TTIP, is still under negotiation. There is also, incidentally, something called Ceta, which stands for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. It is like TTIP but for Canada and Europe and, so far as I understand it, means that Europeans will soon bathing in maple syrup while reading Margaret Atwood novels. Which is probably nicer than it sounds. Ceta is due to be ratified by the European parliament later this year but the document is currently undergoing a process of what is called “legal scrubbing”, which sounds like the sort of thing Americans do to their chickens, but in fact is another species of the kind of gobbledegook rampant in modern life and means minimising the document’s exposure to legal action. But that’s not all. There is also Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was established in 1994 and, proponents of TTIP think, demonstrates the kind of inspiring benefits and harmonisation of standards that might result if TTIP comes into force. Think of it this way. Just as, thanks to Nafta, for the past 21 years Americans have been saying “aboot” and forming their own mariachi bands, Mounties have been wearing sombreros and Mexicans putting maple syrup on their quesadillas, so in the future, thanks to TTIP, Americans might drink coffee from cups the size of thimbles, while Europeans might wear 10-gallon hats even though, on average, we’ve only got six-gallon-sized heads and so would look ridiculous. But seriously. How is TTIP going to affect me? TTIP will hit Europeans like you in the pocket, critics argue, so you need to pay attention. While the European commission estimates that, by 2027, TTIP could boost the size of the EU economy by £94bn or 0.5% of GDP, an economic study by Jeronim Capaldo of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University argues that the commission’s econometric modelling is jejune and that, in fact, TTIP will clobber Europeans. Capaldo predicts 600,000 European job losses as a result of TTIP, a net fall in EU exports, declining GDPs for EU member states and a fall in Europeans’ personal income. Why people are so angry about TTIP? Because Americans are, with all due respect, disgusting slobs always chasing a fast buck and thus very different from us fragrant Europeans who are, like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way. One worry is that the main goal of TTIP is to remove EU regulations that stop its citizens being poisoned, killed or subject to rampant pollution so that more profits can be made by corporations on both sides of the Atlantic. Related: Do you have concerns about TTIP? For instance, critics argue that if TTIP involves, as the EU hopes, a commitment that would guarantee automatic licences for all future US crude oil and gas exports to Europe, that would result in a boom in US fracking to keep Europeans powered with shale gas, not to mention greater exploitation of oil from Canadian tar sands. Such developments, argue critics, would undermine not just the EU’s fuel quality directive but ruin what is left of the planet worth ruining. Consider one aspect of TTIP that is giving European critics the particular pip. It involves another acronym, so steel yourselves. That acronym is ISDS, which stands for “investor-state dispute settlement”. This procedure would allow companies to sue foreign governments over claims of unfair treatment and to be entitled to compensation. Similar provisions in other treaties have allowed, for example, tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris to sue Uruguay and Australia for enacting anti-smoking legislation, and a Swedish energy company to take legal action against Germany for phasing out nuclear power.

'Share on WhatsApp The penalty for running a bad business is supposed to be failure. A free market system relies on the incentive of reward earned through enterprise, but it must also contain risk. The theory holds that evolution is at work, as good business thrives by innovation and competition, while the weak fall away. Meanwhile, democratic governments provide social guarantees so that this natural selection does not inflict cruelty on the citizens who depend on the economy for their livelihoods. That is why the ruin of BHS is a story of political failure as well as a product of commercial mismanagement. The collapse of the famous high street chain, leaving 11,000 jobs in jeopardy and a staff pension fund with a £571m deficit, has been widely reported as a case study of corporate greed. There have been calls for Sir Philip Green, who owned the company for 15 years, to be stripped of his knighthood. Sir Philip, his wife and Dominic Chappell, who heads Retail Acquisitions – the consortium that later bought BHS – look set to be summoned by parliament’s business and work and pensions committees, as part of twin inquiries into the affairs of what is now a hollowed-out shell of a company in administrators’ hands. If these probes go ahead, they might shed some light on the mechanisms by which the value that there once was in BHS was apparently turned to cash and siphoned off. That is if Sir Philip and others deign to attend the committees. They might, like Mike Ashley – the founder of Sports Direct , who now offers himself as an unlikely saviour of the BHS workforce – defy a summons to appear. MPs want to speak to Mr Ashley about low pay and alleged worker exploitation. He dismisses them as “a joke”. That episode testifies to the weakness of political institutions as a check on business. Market fundamentalists used to argue that this is as it ought to be, that politicians should not be allowed to meddle in commerce other than to uphold the law – and that there should be as few laws as possible. “Not just a light touch but a limited touch” was the mantra at one time. But that doctrine’s decline really began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and all the bailouts, government guarantees and taxpayer buy-ups which became necessary in its wake. It was clear then, when the protagonists were bankers not retailers, that the role of the state in the private sector goes well beyond deciding how much or little to regulate. A systemic, perhaps inescapable, transfer of risk to the public realm was laid bare, and the Pension Protection Fund’s prospective rescue of the BHS fund illustrates this once again. Meanwhile, the rewards for failure head offshore. What is acceptable and what is within the letter of the law are not the same thing. That is not to say that the capitalist ethos is inherently corrupt. There will always be a section of the revolutionary left that sees private enterprise as a quasi-criminal requisitioning of public goods. Most moderate left opinion just wants business to be run with more than a patina of social conscience. Ed Miliband made “responsible capitalism” the theme for his leadership of the Labour party. It didn’t translate into an election-winning slogan, and maybe it was never going to. Yet his agenda has been vindicated. It is no longer radical to observe that the short-term sweating of assets for quick profits, over-gearing and underinvestment, avoidance of taxes, poverty wages and job insecurity are symptoms of a disease that limits the shrinks the nation’s economic potential. It is, for example, increasingly common for shareholders to complain, as happened recently at BP , about remuneration packages for senior executives unconnected to commercial reason – or reality. Pay is just one example of a market that is not working as the theory says it should, neither maximising efficiency nor promoting best practice. British capitalism is riddled with failures of that kind. The social consequences, public anger among them, are impossible to ignore. That is not a reason to hate business. Market forces are something to be harnessed or resisted depending on what circumstance requires, not an evil to be despised or abolished. The challenge for politicians is striking a balance between what is permitted, what is encouraged, what is denounced and what is outlawed in markets. The case of BHS is just the latest to prove that the balance has not properly been struck. To leave it without redress will lead to more economic failures which, in time, will bring politics itself further into disrepute – a most dangerous trajectory. ',?
'TTIP What is TTIP? The controversial trade deal proposal explained The EU claims it will create millions of jobs and bring down the cost of living – but others say it is a threat to public services such as the NHS An anti-TTIP banner is held aloft at a rally before the G7 summit in Munich in June. Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters Friday 3 July 2015 09.01 EDT Last modified on Friday 3 July 2015 09.49 EDT Share on WhatsApp If you are not yet familiar with the acronym TTIP it is likely you soon will be. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a proposed trade agreement and the subject of an ongoing series of negotiations between the EU and US aimed at creating the world’s biggest free trade zone spanning the north Atlantic. It would dwarf all past free trade deals: the European commission reckons it could boost the size of the EU economy by €120bn (£85bn) – equal to 0.5% of GDP – and the US economy by €95bn – 0.4% of GDP. Related: I’ve seen the secrets of TTIP, and it is built for corporations not citizens | Molly Scott Cato It would create several million jobs dependent on exports, Brussels says, while consumers would enjoy cheaper products and services. The average European household of four would be around €500 a year better off as a result of wage increases and price reductions, according to the study commissioned from the Centre for Economic Policy Research in 2013 . The plan is to cut tariff barriers – levies imposed to control cross-border trade – to zero and other non-tariff barriers by 25-50%. The study insists this is a realistic prospect. The business sectors that would benefit most include industries based around metal products, processed food and chemicals, and especially the motor industry. In the UK (and elsewhere), the main beneficiaries would be big businesses, as smaller firms are less likely to trade outside Britain. The UK could benefit to the tune of £10bn, which means the average household would be £400 a year better off. The main aim of TTIP is to reduce regulatory barriers to trade, in areas ranging from food safety law to environmental rules and banking regulations. Opponents argue it will water down important EU regulations. Food safety has become a major stumbling block in the negotiations as both sides prepare for the latest round – the 10th – which takes place from 13 to 17 July in Brussels. The talks have been conducted largely in secret, but opposition to TTIP is growing on the ground. More than 2 million people in Europe have signed an online petition against the proposed deal . Campaigners have been outspoken about TTIP’s potential dangers and have painted it as a threat to European democracy. In Britain, MPs on the all-party business, innovations and skills committee have denounced the government’s firm support for TTIP amid fears for the NHS and other public services. Concerns are mounting that TTIP could lead to more privatisation, with the prospect of US corporations providing vital UK public services such as transport, education, water and health. Related: Do you have concerns about TTIP? As highlighted in this Guardian video , another major concern is whether standards will drop. For example, the EU bans cosmetics tested on animals but the US does not. Another question is what happens if EU countries want some protection, for instance Italy for its Parma ham, and the UK for its pork pies. One of the most controversial elements of the trade proposal is the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision. ISDS provisions have been included in many trade deals since the 1980s, to encourage overseas investment in poorer countries. It means private investors can ask a tribunal of international arbitrators to judge if a government has treated them unfairly – and can get compensation. Over the past decade some big, mainly American companies, such as tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris, have used ISDS to claim rights. The provision would in theory allow private investors to sue governments for the loss of future profits due to decisions made by national parliaments. Critics say it could be used to attack the UK’s NHS by making privatisations of specific services harder to reverse. ',?
'Sluggish US growth forms part of a worrying global trend The global economy is running out of steam and the conventional weapons are increasingly ineffective The New York financial district at sunset. In the US, firms are reducing investment – normally the sign of a looming recession. Photograph: Alamy Thursday 28 April 2016 10.19 EDT Last modified on Thursday 28 April 2016 10.54 EDT Share on WhatsApp It would be easy to dismiss the slowdown in the US economy to near-stall speed as a piece of rogue data resulting from the inability of number crunchers at the Department of Commerce in Washington to take account of the fact that large parts of the country are blanketed by snow during the winter. Related: US economy grinds to near standstill as business investment slumps - live updates Easy but wrong. Back in spring 2015, the world’s biggest economy was expanding at an annual rate of 3.9%. In the third quarter the growth rate halved to 2%, before falling again to 1.4% in the final three months of the year. Describing the further easing to 0.5% in the first three months of 2016 as a temporary aberration – which was the knee-jerk response of upbeat analysts on Wall Street – is pushing it a bit. A better explanation is that the sluggishness of US growth is part of a global trend, in which all the major economies are expanding more weakly than they were in the middle of last year. That’s the story for China, the eurozone, Japan and the UK. Each quarter, the data company Markit compiles a global Purchasing Managers’ Index for JP Morgan, with the intention of providing an up-to-date picture of economic conditions. The result for the first three months of 2016 showed activity at its lowest level in more than three years. Nor is there much hint of an improvement in the near future. In the US, firms are hacking back at investment – normally the sign of a looming recession. Consumer confidence has weakened, in part because real incomes are being squeezed. As export-driven economies, Japan and the eurozone rely on a thriving US to buy their goods, so it is no surprise to find both struggling. The Bank of Japan will be forced to revisit its decision not to provide additional stimulus , since the upshot of its inaction has been a sharp rise in the yen, which will lead to even slower growth. Mario Draghi may again have to lock horns with the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann , in order to force through measures aimed at boosting activity in Europe. But the law of diminishing returns is at work. Each cut in interest rates, each fresh dollop of quantitative easing, has less of an impact than the last. The global economy is running out of steam and the conventional weapons are increasingly ineffective. This is not about blizzards shutting factories in Michigan. It goes much deeper than that. ',?
'Eurozone Eurozone factory growth weakens despite heavy discounting Manufacturing PMI edges up to 51.7 in April but survey shows mixed picture given steep price cuts to attract customers Eurozone factories performed only slightly better in April despite deep discounting Photograph: David Jones/PA Reuters Monday 2 May 2016 05.08 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 05.33 EDT Share on WhatsApp Eurozone factories performed slightly better in April, with output not losing as much momentum as initially forecast although growth in activity stayed weak despite deep discounting, a survey shows. There was a mixed picture , with manufacturing growth strong in Italy and Spain last month while Germany showed signs of reviving. Activity in France, however, contracted at the steepest rate in a year. Markit’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the eurozone rose to 51.7 from March’s 51.6. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Related: Europe’s liberal illusions shatter as Greek tragedy plays on “The survey is signalling an anaemic annual rate of growth of manufacturing production of just less than 1%, which is half the pace seen in the months leading up to the recent slowdown,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. “The survey data therefore so far shows no signs of European Central Bank stimulus or the weaker euro helping to revive the manufacturing sector, at least for the euro area as a whole.” The eurozone economy grew 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the January-March period, early data showed last week . While that was more than expected, inflation once again fell below zero last month as energy prices dropped. What is likely to make for grim reading in the survey for ECB policymakers is the deep discounting manufacturers have had to resort to to drum up new business, even though deflationary pressures appear to be easing slightly. The output price index came in below the flash reading of 47.7 at 47.4, higher than March’s 47.1. However, the latest result was the second-lowest since early 2010. Topics ',?
'Australia Post Australia Post to charge up to $9 for delay in collecting packages Parcels are currently held for 10 days for free before being returned to sender, but from August will be held for free for just five business days The Communication Workers Union has described Australia Post’s decision to introduce fees for customers to pick up their parcels as ‘outrageous’ and a ‘gouge’. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP Monday 2 May 2016 03.06 EDT Last modified on Monday 2 May 2016 03.07 EDT Share on WhatsApp Australia Post will slug customers up to $9 for delaying to collect their packages from a post office, the company announced on Monday. Currently, missed deliveries are held by a post office for 10 days free of charge, then returned to sender. From 1 August, packages will be held for free for five business days, and cost $3 to collect after six to 10 business days; $6 after 11 to 15 business days; and $9 for 16 to 30 days. Related: Australia Post increases stamp prices for regular mail from 70 cents to $1 Australia Post said the changes were about “giving customers more time to collect their parcels” and that 92% of customers collected their parcels within five days anyway, avoiding any fee. “We believe this service will help the small amount of customers who can’t collect their parcel straight away,” a spokeswoman said. Packages belonging to MyPost customers will continue to be held for free for 10 days. The Communication Workers Union has described the new charges as a “gouge”. “We’re concerned that the community is being gouged for more money when already their letters have doubled in price and halved in the quality of service, so we’re very concerned about it,” the CWU’s Joan Doyle told the ABC. “We think it’s outrageous that they’ve introduced fees for people to pick up their parcels and we foresee that there will be a lot of fights about whether people got a card in the first place, whether they were at home when the postie or the parcel driver went past, and how long the parcel has been waiting.” The company upped the price of stamps in January from 70c to $1 as it seeks to recover from a $222m loss last year. It announced in April it had completed a so-called digital transformation, to ensure the company’s profitability as letter volumes decline, including the use of delivery drones. ',?
