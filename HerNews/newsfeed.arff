'The web we want Police and tech firms are failing to tackle trolling, says Stella Creasy Labour MP, who was a target of online abuse, says authorities and web companies need to use their resources to tackle issue Stella Creasy, left, and Maria Miller, who both want more action taken on online abuse, though the Labour MP says the laws to tackle it are already in place. Photograph: Getty Images/PA Friday 15 April 2016 09.31 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 17.00 EDT Share on WhatsApp Trolling is still not being taken seriously enough by police and technology companies who already have the tools to take action against internet abusers, the Labour MP Stella Creasy has said. Creasy, who was targeted three years ago by one of the most high-profile Twitter trolls to be jailed , said the key to dealing with online abuse was challenging the underlying inequality, misogyny and prejudice that fuels the problem. But she also raised concerns that the authorities and internet firms are still not treating online crimes in the same way as they would do offline or realising that trolling amounts to harassment. The senior Tory MP Maria Miller earlier this week called for an overhaul of internet legislation to stop online abuse, warning that it may be creating a “nightmare” for society in future. But Creasy, a former shadow crime prevention minister, argued the laws already exist to tackle trolling and said police must examine such allegations as harassment, rather than solely looking at whether they are malicious communications offences. “We do have legislation and it was very frustrating for me as a victim of this stuff who had worked on harassment legislation ... I am particularly frustrated with the police and CPS because I still don’t think they get it in terms of making it a harassment issue, not a malicious content issue. “If someone sends you flowers, if it’s someone you’ve asked never to contact you again, that’s really creepy. But online, unless they’ve said they want to rape or murder you, the police and CPS don’t get it.” Speaking to the Guardian, Creasy said a culture change was needed to make sure victims of online abuse were taken seriously. Telling victims of harassment to stop feeding the trolls or remove their online presence was comparable to asking women to dress differently or stop going out at night, she said. “At the heart of this, it’s not the technology, it’s the inequality . Just as 40 years ago people wanted to define when women could walk the streets, what they could wear and where they could go, it’s exactly the same online. It’s not about the streets, or the technology, it’s about society,” she said. “We have law that could be used but we have to change the frame of reference about it. It is still very much a case of when this stuff happens to you, you get told: ‘Don’t feed the trolls.’ Why is it up to me to find a way of dealing with it rather than them to stop doing it? Why should I not enjoy these types of communication? Just like you wouldn’t say to somebody: ‘Oh just don’t go out at night.’” She also warned that technology companies would kill their own business models if they did not take online harassment more seriously, as people being targeted would retreat to other more private platforms. Creasy is working with Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and former shadow home secretary, on the campaign Reclaim the Internet , echoing the Reclaim the Night movement that has challenged the notion that female victims of violence should change their behaviour. Creasy said the root of the problem could only be tackled by treating the online world the same as the offline world. “It is a pressure and backlash against the freedom that the internet offers people to speak, communicate and organise, which unfortunately an old-fashioned, endemic form of misogyny, discrimination and prejudice is trying to kill,” she said. Creasy was personally targeted in 2013 when she came to the defence of Caroline Criado-Perez , a freelance journalist who received up to 50 rape threats an hour on Twitter in an avalanche of abuse after leading a campaign for women to be featured on banknotes.

'iPhone Apple expects your iPhone to be replaced after three years Apple Watch expected to last only three years too, while Mac computers should last four, plus Apple slip-up points to OS X rebranding as MacOS Apple expects iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches to last only three years for their first buyers. Photograph: Warren R.M. Stuart/Flickr Friday 15 April 2016 05.34 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 11.59 EDT Share on WhatsApp Apple has said that it expects so-called first owners of £500 iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches to replace them after only three years of use, and Mac computers only four. As part of the company’s new environmental push, which includes its new Apps for Earth campaign with the WWF, Apple has listed how long it expects its products to last for their “first owners” and therefore how much they contribute to the greenhouse gas lifecycle. Within a new question and answer section Apple said: “Years of use, which are based on first owners, are assumed to be four years for OS X and tvOS devices and three years for iOS and watchOS devices.” That assessment doesn’t take into account the recycling of devices, their reconditioning and their resale, of course, but when you buy a new iPhone 6S for £539 , Apple expects it to last three years, something many suspected. Apple has been accused of intentionally slowing down iPhones every time a new one is released , although there is little evidence to support the theory. Related: ‘Error 53’ fury mounts as Apple software update threatens to kill your iPhone 6 Until recently the company only provided software support for an iPhone or iPad for around three years, typically providing two major iOS version updates from the moment they were released. The launch of iOS 8 and then iOS 9 , which still supports the iPhone 4S released in October 2011, changed that. Mac computers, however, have much longer software support lives. The latest version of Apple’s computer software OS X 10.11 El Capitan still supports computers from 2007, despite Apple expecting Mac computers to last four years. Apple also slipped up, indicating that it could rebrand its computer operating system OS X as MacOS. The clause talking about the life expectancy of Apple computers originally said it was “assumed to be four years for MacOS and tvOS devices”, but was later changed back into line with current branding to “assumed to be four years for OS X and tvOS devices”. The MacOS brand ceased to be used after version 9.2 in 2001, replaced by OS X 10.0 Cheetah later that year. Whether the slip up and correction indicates that Apple will switch back to its MacOS branding is unknown. The company could be running into issues with its naming, as OS X – pronounced OS 10 – is currently at version 10.11. Will it continue to use decimal places to describe its new OS versions, or will it revert back to MacOS and release an eleventh version? And will anyone care what it’s called beyond technology enthusiasts? ',?
'Pinterest PlayKids. PlayKids is a direct rival to Hopster, having expanded across the world from its origins in Latin America. It offers a similar blend of TV shows and educational games. There’s less of a British emphasis to its shows: those available include Pocoyo, Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood, Om Nom’s Stories – Om Nom being the hero of the Cut the Rope mobile games – Stella and Sam and Sid the Science Kid. The games are a mix of memory, puzzles and other educational content, as well as music and colouring activities, and a recently-introduced foreign language-learning section. You can create individual profiles for your children. PlayKids has a certain amount of shows and games for free, but its premium “PlayKids Club” subscription costs £2.99 a month to unlock everything. Which app is right for your children? Hopster and PlayKids have the toughest task of this group: they’re trying to persuade parents to stump up for a new monthly subscription, against competition that’s either free or which parents are likely already paying for. Both are worth trying: blending educational games with TV is an inventive idea. Meanwhile, DisneyLife should benefit from having a community of fanatical Disneyphiles (of all ages) to aim for. For the rest, which app you choose likely depends on your existing media diet. If you already subscribe to Netflix, chances are you’ll create profiles for your children. If you got an Amazon Prime membership for the free shipping, you may try its video app. If you’re a Sky TV household, the Sky Kids app is an obvious download. Finally, BBC iPlayer Kids and YouTube Kids complement one another well for British parents: the best of public-service children’s broadcasting in the UK on one side, and a safer way for kids to navigate the online wild west of YouTube on the other.

'Share on WhatsApp At Facebook’s F8 conference in Silicon Valley, David Marcus, the company’s head of messaging, proudly demonstrated its new suite of chatbots . Users can now get in a conversation with the likes of CNN, H&M, and HP, and ask for help shopping, or the latest headlines. The chatbots aren’t very good , but that doesn’t mean Facebook isn’t proud of them anyway: “I guarantee you’re going to spend way more money than you want on this,” Marcus chuckled on stage. But even though Facebook might want to sell itself as the pioneer of chatbots, the real leaders in the field aren’t working in the AI research teams of silicon valley; they’re collaborating at events like last week’s BotSummit in the V&A, or this weekend’s Art of Bots exhibition in Somerset House. Move over chatbots: it’s time to meet the artbots. BotSummit, now in its fourth year but held outside the US for the first time, is the creation of internet artist Darius Kazemi, whose medium he describes as “bots and generators and other weird internet stuff”. Kazemi has become particularly famous for his Twitterbots – single-purpose accounts on the social network with names like TwoHeadlines and Glitch Logos . — Two Headlines (@TwoHeadlines) April 13, 2016 Kate Hudson Imports Record Crude Oil as Higher Margins Boosts Buying Kazemi describes the former, typical of his early work, as “an attempt to kill a certain kind of joke” – specifically, the waggish concept of mistaking two pieces of news for one unified story, exclaiming something along the lines of “I can’t believe the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took out an injunction to stop the press reporting on their trip to India!” TwoHeadlines uses Google News to make the same joke automatically, stripping out the object of one headline and replacing it with the object of another – and then doing it again, and again, and again. The account has made the same basic joke almost 21,000 times in two and a half years, though it hasn’t yet stopped people making the joke themselves. — Glitch Logos (@GlitchLogos) March 26, 2016 s̈ͪh͐ͯ̽ͨ̅͑o̔ͩ̚pͣ̌ f̧̧ó͞r҉ g̝͚͖̫̮̼̲r̞̯̮͙̩ͅo͙̠̙̩̮̯c͚̥̟͈̯̰͈er̦̝ͅi̜̘̞e̜͈̥̣s̤̮̫̘̠͇̼ in style https://t.co/QPv75kDeJC pic.twitter.com/pj8zFDvkNB Glitch Logos is a more visual project, taking the logos of world-renowned brands and randomly corrupting them. It’s inspired by another well-known bot artist, Allison Parrish, and her bot Smiling Face Withface , which posts similarly corrupted images of emoji to Tumblr. Parrish is the artist behind perhaps the most famous artbot to date, Everyword , which launched on Twitter in 2007 and promptly began tweeting every word in the English language, from A to Z (and then a little further, to É). It finished its task in 2014. — everyword (@everyword) December 13, 2013 twitter Both Parrish and Kazemi have exhibits at this weekend’s Art of Bots exhibition, run by digital culture festival Abandon New Devices (AND) and curated by British-Colombian Matthew Plummer-Fernandez – another BotSummit attendee. Plummer-Fernandez spoke about how the artbot world needed to move beyond easy and obvious platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and make algorithmic art that could spread on more obscure or less generalist mediums. His latest project, Shiv Intiger, introduced at the V&A Museum, is one example of that. This project, a co-creation with Julien Deswaef, lives on Thingiverse, a site for sharing models for 3D printers. The bot scans the site for freely licensed 3D models, and randomly smashes them together, producing bizarre mixtures of machine parts, toys and artistic objects. ',?
'Pinterest In trying to explain his work to the rest of his team, Finley used a whiteboard to map out the swatters via various VoIP services and proxies. Photograph: Sgt Ben Finley/Johns Creek Police Department Finley used an email address associated with one Skype account to uncover a personal website for the second swatter, whose online handle was Obnoxious. Using that email, he found a page on the text-sharing website Pastebin where one of Obnoxious’s enemies had revealed his name and address. According to that page, Obnoxious was a minor living in Coquitlam, British Columbia. When Finley called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Vancouver, they knew exactly whom Finley was talking about – the youth was already on probation for similar crimes . With the help of the FBI, Finley pored over the mountains of evidence, eventually connecting Obnoxious to more than 40 incidents. (He was also the subject of a New York Times magazine profile , The Serial Swatter, in November 2015.) “This kid was unbelievable,” Finley says. “He was calling everyone and everything – schools, businesses, private residences, law enforcement, the FBI’s weapons of mass destruction hotline, even Disneyland. Nothing was sacred to him.” In November 2014, the RCMP asked Finley to send him evidence for the strongest 10 cases he had built against Obnoxious so they could obtain a search warrant for his home. Then Obnoxious decided to take his act public. On 1 December 2014, he live-streamed swatting two homes in Ohio on YouTube , boasting about it first on Twitter. The parents of one previous swatting victim saw it and called Finley, who then notified the RCMP. Four days later, the 17-year-old was arrested. In May 2015 he pleaded guilty to 23 counts of extortion, public mischief, and criminal harassment; he was later sentenced to 16 months in youth custody and was due to be released in April 2016. ‘A different perspective when you’re the mom in the doorway’ One of the problems with pursuing swatters is that, in most jurisdictions, swatting itself is not a crime, though the act might violate other local laws such as abuse of emergency response services. Another is that law enforcement agencies usually lack the expertise or the resources to investigate such crimes. In November 2015, around the same time that reports about Obnoxious became public, congresswoman Katherine Clark, a Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced a bill that made swatting a federal crime . (The bill has been referred to the House subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations .) Finley has been working with state officials to introduce a similar bill in the Georgia state legislature. On 31 January 2016, the second-term congresswoman was the victim of a swatting attack on her home in Melrose, Massachusetts – an attack she believes was directly related to her bill. “I’d heard all about swatting and have talked to the victims,” she says. “But you get a different perspective when you’re the mom standing in the doorway, with your family in the house behind you, looking at a full police response with long guns drawn on your front lawn. It gave me an idea of how frightening and dangerous this could be. And it made me more determined than ever to do something about it.” Katherine Clark was the victim of a swatting attack on her home in Melrose, Massachusetts – an attack she believes was directly related to her bill. Photograph: Katherine Clark In March, Clark addressed the second part of the problem – the lack of law enforcement expertise – by introducing the Cybercrime Enforcement Training Assistance Act , which would allocate $20m a year to train local police departments on how to investigate and prosecute cybercrime. “I’ve heard from many victims of severe online threats who say police departments want to be helpful but aren’t sure how to protect someone who’s been harassed online,” she says. “It’s not from a lack of will or compassion, they just don’t know how best to proceed.” Anonymity is being misused The third, much more difficult problem, is the relative ease with which individuals can operate relatively anonymously on the internet, using free VoIP numbers, encrypted communications, proxy servers that obscure internet protocol addresses, and similar technologies. As Finley demonstrated, it’s not impossible to hunt down suspects who use these technologies – it’s just extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive. Finley estimates he spent more than a thousand hours tracking down those two teenagers, neither of whom will spend much time behind bars, yet this is a crime that can cost police departments as much as $100,000 per incident and could result in fatalities. It’s a crime they’re far more motivated to solve than, say, threats issued via Twitter. Despite all this, there are some who argue that the ability to remain anonymous on the internet is essential, and a sign of a healthy government. “The ability to speak anonymously enables people to express minority opinions,”said Greg Norcie, staff technologist for the Center for Democracy & Technology . “We’re not going to have a situation where we always solve every crime. If you create a situation where society is without crime and risk, it ends up being very totalitarian.” As a result, successful prosecution of online harassers is likely to remain relatively rare, with only the most egregious offenders being pursued. “Technology changes every day, and it’s hard to stay on top of it, along with all the other things we have to stay on top of, like terrorism and people shooting things up,” says Finley. “The internet is like the Wild Wild West. People think they can do whatever they want there, but every now and then the marshal comes to town to restore the peace and get the troublemakers.” ',?
'Censorship GreatFire activist urges western firms to help end Chinese censorship Activist working for group dedicated to fighting China’s ‘Great Firewall’ says firms such as Apple should back up its words with actions Google’s Beijing headquarters in 2010, before the company withdrew from the state over censorship. Photograph: Sinopix/Rex Thursday 14 April 2016 12.07 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 12.22 EDT Share on WhatsApp Western companies need to end their hypocrisy over free speech in China , and start helping to end censorship in the country, a leading anti-censorship activist has told the Guardian. One of the three co-founders of GreatFire, an organisation dedicated to fighting the so-called Great Firewall of China, the technological heart of state censorship in the country, said it hurts to see companies such as Apple citing Chinese censorship in their battles with western governments, while co-operating with authoritarian state in order to earn money from its burgeoning middle classes and take advantage of its enormous manufacturing base. Speaking in London shortly before winning a Freedom of Expression award from campaign group Index on Censorship , the activist, who goes by the pseudonym Charlie Smith due to the threat to his safety if the Chinese government discovers his identity, listed Apple and LinkedIn amongst his personal villains. Technology firms, including Apple, often cite China when arguing with western states about repressive internet restrictions. But Smith accuses them of not backing their words up with actions, and instead working hand-in-glove with the Chinese state o profit from the country’s vast internal market. In contrast, he praised Wikipedia and Github for their principled stands against censorship. He also praised Google for their decision in 2010 to stop censoring search results and pull out of mainland China. The praise for Google was tempered with caution, however, due to reports that the company might be re-entering the Chinese market to sell smartphone apps through the Play Store . “What is that going to involve?” Smith asked. “I think people are going to be very wary and attentive to how Google goes back into China. And hopefully they’re going to show us that there is a way to go back in without having to censor. Pinterest A Chinese mobile phone shop advertising Apple products in 2013. GreatFire accuses the US tech firm of aiding censorship in China. Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters “It would be a shame to see that,” he added. “I would be disappointed, and I know that a lot of other people would be disappointed, if Google went back in and said ‘we’re going to censor our search results again’, because they’ve made that mistake already, and they should understand that the situation hasn’t changed. But they did take a very public stand, and they’re one of the few companies to take a very public stand.” The Play Store is particularly sensitive, because it’s one of the primary outlets through which GreatFire works, releasing anti-censorship tools such as FreeBrowser , FreeWeibo and the recently announced FreeWeChat . The group was founded in 2011 to raise awareness about the Great Firewall of China, primarily through cataloguing which sites were blocked internally In recent years, however, it has pivoted to more direct action. Smith explains that the change was borne out of a serendipitous discovery. In January 2013, a White House petition was created calling on the Obama administration to deny entry to the architects of state censorship. The petition was backed up by a long list of such architects, hosted on the code sharing site GitHub. And so, on January 18 2013, Github was blocked in China . I’d say to them, well, what have you accomplished? What improvements have been made? Unlike most previous sites censored by the state, Github is not just a news site or a social network: it is crucial to the working lives of a significant proportion of the programming community, as well as being a host for a number of important repositories required to make the internet work. And so, five days later, the site was unblocked in a rare event, and one that led to GreatFire’s concept of “collateral freedom”. “There are sites that are too valuable for the authorities to block, mainly for economic reasons,” Smith says. “So that’s when we started to work on this strategy of collateral freedom. And that strategy was basically leveraging the, for want of a better phrase, global internet infrastructure, to deliver uncensored content back in to China.” GreatFire used the collateral freedom approach to develop apps, as well as post uncensored content on cloud services such as Amazon’s AWS, where it could not be blocked by the Chinese authorities without taking down vast swathes of the net. But other companies weren’t as eager as Github and Amazon to help GreatFire. In October 2013, the group finished its FreeWeibo app, which archives posts that have been removed from Weibo, China’s Twitter. “We figured out a way to make it censorship-proof,” Smith said. “It was available on the app store, people could download it and the app could be updated. And we kinda got round all the restrictions that the authorities put in place there. But then the authorities just called Apple, and said ‘can you remove the app?’ and Apple said yes. And it was gone and that was it.” Pinterest A user browses Weibo. GreatFire’s FreeWeibo app helped users bypass restrictions until it was removed by Apple. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images Responses such as Apple’s are why Smith says he has an issue with companies citing China when arguing against repressive government measures in the west. For instance, in its battle with the FBI over whether it could be forced to weaken the security on its own hardware, Apple repeatedly brought up China. Tim Cook specifically singled out China when he said that the governmental request was so unprecedented that no other country had asked for similar access. In the UK, arguments against the “snooper’s charter”, a bill that gives the British government huge power to eavesdrop on encrypted connections, have also been made with regard to China. The bill, some worry, would embolden the country to demand its own repressive changes. Smith scoffs at that scenario, saying: “China doesn’t need that precedent. It does it anyway.” More generally, he finds it hard to square tech firms’ pleas in the west, positioning China as unacceptably authoritarian, with the fact that they happily work in China, aiding government censorship. “I’ve been involved with China for a long time. This discussion’s been happening for a long time,” says Smith. “Post-Tiananmen Square, a lot of companies left. But at that time, it was different. There wasn’t this rich middle class willing to buy your goods. It was a lot easier for companies to make the morally correct decision to pull out. “But then, when they started coming back, they started saying ‘it’s better to have this conversation’. The world’s biggest internet companies, when they go there, they say that too. And I’d say to them, well, what have you accomplished? What improvements have been made? What has changed since the time you came in and said ‘engagement is better’? How have you improved the human rights situation? How have you improved the internet freedom situation? How have you improved access to information?” Some things, at least, have changed in the three years GreatFire has been chipping away at the Great Firewall. Not always for the better: In 2015, the censorship authorities, apparently realising that the collateral freedom approach was bearing fruit, switched tactics, turning on what was described as the “Great Cannon” . This is a modified version of a conventional hacking tactic known as a “distributed denial of service” attack. By redirecting the connections of millions of Chinese internet users, the authorities were able to make the firewall into an offensive weapon, overloading the connections of those they had been unable to take down by more conventional means. That cannon was pointed at Github and at GreatFire’s Amazon hosting. Although it failed to fully knock the sites offline, it cost the cash-strapped organisation a fair amount of money. But the emboldened tactics give Smith hope that, one way or another, the fight will be over soon. “No way do I want to be talking to you in five years,” he says with a sigh. “We don’t want to continue doing this. It’s hard to live a double life.” That said, “over soon” doesn’t necessarily mean China dropping its web censorship. Smith sees two ways the standoff can end: one possibility is that the state eventually gets over its fear of what the people would do if they saw the real internet, and drops the firewall. “That’s not going to have a revolutionary outcome though,” he says. Unlike many internet freedom campaigners, he’s sanguine about the actual change that will be wrought. If the censorship is dropped, he says, “most people will probably just sign up for Facebook and then carry on with their lives”. The other possibility is that the “collateral freedom” approach fails, and the country drops the firewall still further, blocking sites such as Github and Amazon. But even that would be a victory of sorts, pushing the country into a direct standoff with its people, and forcing its ruling class to decide between authoritarianism and economic success. Whichever it is, the status quo can’t last. “Technology is this enabling thing,” he says, “helping people to right wrongs. And it’s moving so fast. Something has to change.” ',?
'Apple Apple might let developers pay to have their apps promoted in the app store A secretive team has been assigned to explore improvements to the app store, according to reports, including better search and paid options Apple’s app store has presented a problem for developers and users, and the store has become populated with more than 1.5m apps.

The company has a dedicated team of 100 people working on plans to overhaul the store, the report claims – citing sources familiar with the project – and is led by Todd Teresi, formerly the head of Apple’s iAd advertising group. A new paid search option would let developers pay for their app to appear alongside related search terms such as weather or puzzle. It could also create a new revenue stream for Apple and deploy staff from iA, which is being cut back. It is also exploring how to improve search for users, making apps easier to find. The app store sells more than 1.5m apps for Apple phones, tablets, and now the Apple Watch. But developers commonly complain that there are so many apps for sale it can be hard to promote their apps. Apple also tightly controls curation of its app store, and the highest profile apps are either hand-selected by them or are already in the store’s list of the 20 bestselling paid and free apps in each genre.

'Pinterest Jill Filipovic: ‘I stopped going to class. When I did go, I would wear a hooded sweatshirt or hide my face.’ Photograph: Siegfried Modola for the Guardian Towards the end of my first semester of law school, a classmate mentioned a website where my name came up a lot. When another acquaintance mentioned the same thing I Googled around and found a message board for law school students called AutoAdmit. I read a couple of the threads, and they just seemed a little weird and creepy. If something came up about my law school, they would mention me. For instance, when someone wrote “Someone barfed in the law school library” the first comment would be “Was it JillF?” Suddenly I realised those same people writing rape fantasies about me could be sitting next to me in contract law class I don’t know why they started on me, but I think it was because I was a feminist blogger, who wrote for Feministe . I was used to nasty comments from the blog, but then I found a post called “The official Jill Filipovic rape thread”. Elsewhere there were long discussions about whether posters would like to “hate-fuck” me. One post read “I want to brutally rape that Jill slut.” Another: “I’m 98% sure that she should be raped.” There were a bunch of photos of me, my Facebook profile had been copied and pasted, my email address was on there. The psychological turning point was reading comments like, “I saw her in class today and she said this… ” Suddenly I realised those same people writing rape fantasies about me could be sitting next to me in contract law class. It wasn’t just a nasty comment on the internet anymore. It felt very intimidating. I corresponded privately with the people who ran the website, but they wouldn’t do anything about the posts. The university was very sympathetic, but said there wasn’t anything they could do. I stopped going to class for some time. When I did go, I would wear a hooded sweatshirt or hide my face. I felt very suspicious and isolated. My friends didn’t understand blogs or message boards so it was hard to explain it to them. In the end I went to therapy, which really helped. There were two episodes when it crossed over into my real life. Once a man sent me an email saying he had been to New York University and spoken to my professors about what a “dumb cunt” I was. The second was when I was studying in the law school office with a friend. A man came to the door and asked me if I was Jill, then started screaming at me. Finally two other women who had been posted about on AutoAdmit sued the men who ran it. One of the men was a law student, and when the case made the papers his law firm rescinded their offer of a contract. The forum had a lot of users, many who said they were practising lawyers, and the legal industry is small. I felt like my identity was being filtered through this one site. I worked in a law firm for four years, but at networking events whenever someone stared at my name tag I worried they recognised me from those threads. Had they seen the pictures of me in a bikini that were posted? It had a huge impact on me. I spent years in fight or flight mode. Now I am very quick to be defensive online. I think having people who can support you (bloggers, or friends) is key. If I write something controversial, I give a friend my Twitter login so they can block abusive messages before I see them. I’m glad that harassment against women online is talked about properly now. I am so hardened to it, I don’t get upset about much anymore. Natalie Farzaneh, 19, retail assistant, London, 2009 As a lonely teenager you will try anything and go anywhere to make friends so I tried another site I was bullied at school, but being bullied online was even worse. Growing up I lived in a very white, middle class village outside York. My father is Iranian and that was always an issue. I was also bigger than the other children – taller and overweight too. At school I was called Paki, Terrorist or Taliban and the children would make fun of my weight and my thick, curly hair. I was pushed down the stairs, and kids would throw chewing gum in my hair. Because I was lonely, I joined Facebook. I got lots of friend requests. I didn’t realise they were just being sarcastic, taking screenshots of my page and laughing about it with their friends. Sometimes people would do weird Photoshopped pictures of my head on a pig’s body. One of the worst points was when someone wrote on the school’s Facebook page “That awkward moment when you realise you are Natalie Farzaneh”. I felt like I was being attacked from all sides. As a lonely teenager you will try anything and go anywhere to make friends so I tried another site, Ask.fm. On it people can ask you questions anonymously – I thought it would help show people I was a nice person. Instead I got horrible messages, saying “Why are you so ugly?” Or “Why are you so fat?” I didn’t really tell my parents how bad things were. My mother and teachers knew I was picked on at school, and I had a youth worker who was great. But online things got worse. People would post things like, “Kill yourself tonight or someone will do it tomorrow” or “Watch your back” or “I hope your parents get cancer”. Because they were anonymous it made me paranoid. I would be sitting in a class full of people, worrying who was sending them. I started self harming and felt suicidal. People who haven’t been bullied online will say “Why didn’t you just turn off your computer?” But they don’t understand. You want to know what people are writing, even if it hurts. One day reading my Ask.fm inbox I felt like I couldn’t breathe. My heart was racing. I went to my mum and said “I think I am dying.” She took me to the hospital, and said it was just a panic attack. Later I was diagnosed with anxiety – I was about 12. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome. What helped was finding an online bullying charity when I was 14. I applied to be one of their ambassadors and I started doing media interviews. Although my parents were heartbroken when they heard how bad things had got, telling other people that help was available made me feel stronger. Other victims would say I made them feel less alone and had stopped them doing something stupid. I felt like I was turning a negative into a positive. When the kids in school saw me on TV and in newspapers some of them also started realising the effect they’d had. Some would say “I hope you realise it was just banter.” Some of my teachers also said they hadn’t known how hard it had been. Today I am very happy, living in London with my boyfriend, and being a body positive blogger. I might get the odd nasty comment online but now I am older I don’t obsess over hateful things. I still work as an anti-bullying ambassador and wish people would take online bullying more seriously. Bruises and cuts heal but you don’t forget the names people call you.

'Facebook What you missed at Facebook’s F8 developer event - at a glance Artificial intelligence, virtual reality and chatbots – Facebook 2016 developer event revealed ambitious plans for expanding its social empire High flyer: Mark Zuckerberg and a drone on stage during the Facebook F8 conference in San Francisco, California. Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters Jemima Kiss and Nellie Bowles in San Francisco Wednesday 13 April 2016 17.40 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 15.33 EDT Share on WhatsApp Facebook’s (mostly) annual developer event in San Francisco has been running since 2007. Over that time it has morphed from an insider code-builder’s event to a high-profile launch event, and though the developers are still there Facebook’s message is now rather more well honed when it comes to translating their mission to the masses. This year, chatbots and virtual reality grabbed the most attention, but there were many smaller but significant announcements too. Here’s everything you need to know from this year’s event. Messenger bots Pinterest Mr Messenger: David Marcus, Facebook vice president of messaging products, talks about bots. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP Facebook’s Messenger app, which has 900 million active monthly users, now has a new platform that allows developers to build services that work inside the chat tool. No messing here: Facebook says it is “focused on facilitating messages from businesses”, whether a hotel reservations systems, customer service or – Zuckerberg’s favorite plug of the day – 1-800-Flowers, which can order personalized flower delivery without leaving the Messenger app. Bots now include Uber and Lyft, which allow users to order cabs; Dutch airline KLM, which will now issue boarding passes; Hyatt hotels which will send reservation details; and clothing store Zulily, which will track orders. What seems like a fiddly novelty with no clear purpose will now very quickly become a staple part of our internet experience, just as apps were before it and mobile phones before that. And Facebook has a bulging revenues book to demonstrate its track record in matching technology with businesses more than willing to pay up. ‘Fearful voices building walls’: Mark Zuckerberg makes veiled attack on Donald Trump. Opening the event, Zuckerberg made a discreet dig at Donald Trump’s wall-building talk and stated his support for immigration as an essential part of attracting talent. He demonstrated how Facebook’s live video feature can film and broadcast video from different hardware using a drone to fly over the heads of the audience. He previewed the latest work on Aquila, Facebook’s ongoing project to use high-altitude unmanned drones to beam internet to the developing world, and also queued up the most significant new products, from Messenger’s chatbots to the Oculus touch controllers. And there was only the briefest of mentions to the obstacles Facebook has hit in rolling out its free, limited internet service around the world. Pinterest Facebook demonstrating its ‘social presence’ experiment. Facebook demonstrated how two people, in entirely different places, can interact in a virtual reality space, dropping themselves into a 360 degree image of their choice. Both characters could adopt a caricature of their choice, draw props for each other and take selfies – in this case “outside” the Houses of Parliament in London. The VR team is focused on “social presence”, combining the ability to interact with surroundings, and representing body language as well as voice. Artificial intelligence Pinterest Facebook is running 50 times more AI experiments than this time last year. Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters Facebook’s applied machine learning team has built what it calls an “ AI backbone ” that is used by 25% of all Facebook engineers across the company, which is running 50 times more AI experiments than this time last year. One of those projects is translation, which is used by 800 million people every month, Facebook says, along with photo image search, “talking pictures” – which recognizes natural language descriptions of photos just by analyzing the image – and classification of video images according to subject, which means all your cat videos can more efficiently be grouped together. Facebook live video The live video tool will be opened up to developers so they can build new applications around it. It can combine audio and video from different sources to add effects, can access and monitor comments and shares on streams and and can be integrated with other hardware devices to broadcast live video from a drone, for example. Oculus touch controllers Pinterest Touch controllers for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets. Photograph: Stephen Lam/Reuters Facebook’s virtual reality company will launch a handset later in 2016 that will allow the user to touch objects and interact with people in a virtual space. “This will allow a whole new layer of immersion, a whole new set of social experiences across all these VR platforms … experiences you can’t have with any existing platform today,” said Zuckerberg, announcing the new device. Facebook 360 Facebook has built a prototype system with 17 cameras that films high quality, 3D, 360 degree ‘spherical’ video. Rather than get into the camera business, Facebook is publishing the hardware and software details on GitHub later this year so that technologists can build their own 360 cameras. More than 20,000 videos have been filed for Facebook 360 so far. Free Basics Facebook’s ambitious but slightly troubled plan to provide a limited but free selection of apps for mobile phone users in the developing world has now reached 25 million users. A new simulator will allow developers to test their app in an environment that mimics poor connectivity, while a new demographics tool gives anonymized information about people using their app, including their region and gender. Internet connectivity Social networking isn’t enough, and neither is beaming internet connectivity from a high-altitude drone for the developing world; Facebook wants to provide wireless internet for underserved urban areas in the western world too. It announced the Terragraph project, which will provide high-speed connections at a relatively low cost . The 60GHz signal can’t travel long distances, but can be easily manipulated around buildings in dense urban areas. Terragraph is being tested at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters in California, and the nearby city of San Jose. The second project is ARIES, a proof of concept that transmits bandwidth very efficiently over a relatively small amount of spectrum. Facebook wants this technology to be made available to the academic research community so it can be improved, and is also interested in developing it for use in rural areas where one small chunk of bandwidth has to go a long way. Developer tools The new “ account kit ” feature allows people to log in to apps more easily, with just an email or phone number, and with SMS login support for 230 countries. “ Profile expression ” allows users to add videos from third party apps to their Facebook profile page, including Cinemagraph Pro and Vine. Saving articles and quotes A save button that lets people save stories, videos and products on online stores to their Facebook ‘saved’ folder. A small but significant feature that spells bad news for bookmarking tools like Pinboard and Pocket. Added to that, a new quote sharing tool lets developers build apps that format quotes nicely, and allows them to easily highlight and share quotes from articles and web pages. New developer tools ',?
'Smartphones World’s cutest smartphone robot can be yours for a hefty price tag RoBoHoN is adorable, can recognise your face, read your messages aloud, wake you up and announce phone calls, but is probably out of your price range Thursday 14 April 2016 10.14 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 10.22 EDT Share on WhatsApp The cutest robo-smartphone ever made is hitting shelves in Japan next month - but is it cute enough to drop almost £1,300? RoBoHoN (which translates roughly as “heart moving phone”) is an adorable tiny robot, which doubles up as a smartphone. Or is it a smartphone that doubles up as a robot? Either way, the happy little bot is a surprisingly powerful piece of technology in its own right. Created by Japanese electronics firm Sharp, RoBoHoN is a 20cm tall robot phone. It’s capable of walking around your home or office (but probably on a table rather than the floor) and acts as a small personal assistant. It’ll read out phone messages, announce phone calls and even shout at you when it’s time to wake up. Pinterest RoBoHoN shows off its many features. But as well as being a supercharged, super-cute version of Siri, the bot is also equipped with facial recognition technology that allows it to interact with its owner on a more personal level, greeting them by name as they enter the room. The projector buried in its head also allows it to beam images on to flat surfaces: perfect for sharing photos, or (apparently) beaming a picture of some food on to a plate so you can copy the layout of the dish. Of course, the downside to all this is that if you want to use your adorable phonebot as an actual phone, you’ll have to hold what looks like a child’s toy to your ear, bum-side first. Oh yes, there’s another downside too: the price. RoBoHoN costs ¥198,000 (£1,282), and there’s a recurring service fee to pay on top of that. But I’ve had friendships far more expensive – and less fulfilling – than the one RoBoHoN offers, and not one of them has been with someone with a projector installed in their forehead. ',?
'Microsoft Microsoft sues for right to tell customers when US government requests emails Traditional searches or wiretaps often require government to eventually notify the people they’ve searched; Microsoft wants the same to apply to emails ‘People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,’ said Microsoft in its court filing. Photograph: Ted S Warren/AP Thursday 14 April 2016 13.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 15.45 EDT Share on WhatsApp Microsoft sued the US government on Thursday for the right to tell customers when authorities search their email inboxes. In a federal complaint that names the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, the company argues the government has taken advantage of the consumer trend for storing their private data on tech companies’ servers, rather than storing it on their own devices. This shouldn’t let the government search the digital equivalent of a person’s desk without telling them, Microsoft argues. The government counters that doing so may tip off suspects of a criminal investigation. Related: Uber claims US regulators collect too much data on its passengers The salvo marks the latest effort by a major US technology firm to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding modern electronic surveillance. It comes after several attempts in recent years by Twitter, Google and Microsoft to have gag orders about surveillance requests removed. The industry has a renewed confidence in taking on the government following Apple’s recent stare-down with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . In this case, Microsoft wants a judge to rule a statute unconstitutional that allows the government to request indefinite gag orders on warrants for suspects’ emails. With traditional searches or wiretaps, the government is often required to notify people they have been searched after some period of time. That’s not the case with digital communications like email, which is covered by legislation including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). “People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,” Microsoft said in its court filing. “The transition to the cloud does not alter the fundamental constitutional requirement that the government must – with few exceptions – give notice when it searches and seizes the private information or communications of individuals or businesses.” The company said that the government has forced Microsoft to maintain secrecy on 2,576 legal demands during the past 18 months. In nearly 70% of those cases, Microsoft says, the gag order is indefinite. “We are reviewing the filing,” said Emily Pierce, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice. For legal scholars, Microsoft’s battle in this case reflects a broader fight over a trend of more and more court orders being filed under seal or, in national security cases, classified. Related: San Bernardino iPhone: US ends Apple case after accessing data without assistance “How can we tell if the court process is legitimate if so much of it is under seal?” asked Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. Compared with other technology companies, Microsoft hasn’t been as outspoken on ideological topics such as unbreakable encryption. During the Apple fight, its general counsel Brad Smith spoke out in favor of the iPhone maker but also made it clear he wanted to find ways to work with law enforcement. To that end, Smith, a Microsoft veteran, in recent years has made efforts to bring more transparency and structure to electronic surveillance, rather than trying to end it outright. Since Edward Snowden leaked a trove of documents on western surveillance practices, Microsoft has successfully resolved two lawsuits that allowed it to say more about the data requests from the government. In a third case that is ongoing, the company is challenging whether it has to give the US government data stored on a server in Ireland. “We view this case as similar to the other three that we have filed,” Smith wrote in a blog post. “It involves the fundamental right of people and businesses to know when the government is accessing their content and our right to share this information with them.” ',?
'ISPs MPs call for reforms over misleading broadband speed claims Customers should be able to leave contracts and get compensation if they have been misled by service providers, parliamentarians say The MPs report found that customers had ‘very few rights’ and must be given more powers to act if broadband speeds do not reach the levels promised. Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA Press Association Saturday 16 April 2016 04.28 EDT Last modified on Saturday 16 April 2016 07.23 EDT Share on WhatsApp The way broadband speed is advertised is misleading and must be reformed, a cross-party group of MPs has said. Customers should be able to leave contracts and be given compensation if they have been misled by service providers, according to the British Infrastructure Group. It also criticised the fact that only one in 10 broadband users need to be able to obtain the fastest advertised speed, under Advertising Standards Authority guidelines. Pinterest Grant Shapps. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Grant Shapps , who set up the group, described the situation as “extraordinary”. The former Conservative party chairman said tougher laws would be needed if internet service providers and the ASA failed to act. “Clearly there is an issue with broadband in this country,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “This is talking about all internet service providers who are failing to provide anything like the speeds they are advertising. Of course, once you are in the contract you can’t leave it and you don’t get compensation.” The infrastructure group’s report found that customers had “very few rights” and must be given more powers to act if broadband speeds do not reach the levels promised. Shapps said: “Rather than one in 10, it should be nine in 10 people receive the speeds. You should get automatic compensation. You should be able to leave the contract and if we can’t get the internet service providers, or indeed, the regulators, to do that, well then parliament will need to act.” ',?
'Pinterest Lewinsky leaves her lawyer’s office in 1998; she ‘came very close’ to suicide after being pilloried by the media. Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP She drifted back to London and had coffee with her old LSE professor, Sandra Jovchelovitch. “She said to me, ‘Whenever power is involved, there always has to be a competing narrative. And you have no narrative.’ It was true. I had mistakenly thought that if I retreated from public life the narrative would dissipate. But instead it ran away from me even more.” That’s when Lewinsky realised she had to do something to de-objectify herself. *** The same words tend to come up again and again when I’ve asked shamed people to describe the most tumultuous aspects of the experience. One of those words is “objectification”. Being shamed feels like being a victim of identity theft. One minute you’re a private individual, working out who you are, your likes and dislikes. The next minute, you’re America’s premier blowjob queen. The writer Mike Daisey described this sensation to me in a chillingly perceptive way. (He’d been publicly shamed for embellishing the facts of a story about visiting Apple manufacturing plants in China.) “What they want is for me to die,” he said. “They will never say this because it’s too histrionic. But they never want to hear from me again, and while they’re never hearing from me, they have the right to use me as a cultural reference point whenever it services their ends. That’s how it would work out best for them.” Lewinsky lets out a long sigh of recognition when I quote this to her. “Wow,” she says. “Mike Daisey carried on,” I say. “He said, ‘I’d never had the opportunity to be the object of hate before. The hard part isn’t the hate. It’s the object.’” Something else that often comes up is how lonely it feels. “The fear of ostracisation strikes at the core of who we are,” Lewinsky says. “We cannot survive alone.” Don’t bully the bully. It doesn’t move the conversation forward These days, she’s often approached by victims of online bullying, “when I’m on the subway, in line for coffee, at dinner parties.” Shamed people tend to seek each other out, the cure for shame being empathy. “Sometimes they’ll say, ‘I went through this, but it’s nothing like what you went through.’ But I tell them that, if I drown in 60ft of water and you drown in 30ft, we both still drowned. You either know what it’s like to be publicly shamed or you don’t.” And so she’s spent much of the past few years trying to formulate practical advice for them. “To be able to give a purpose to my past, if I’m stuck with my past, feels meaningful to me,” she says. Her number one piece of advice: “Integrate what has happened to you. Integrate the experience, the faster the better.” She knows this can be hard. “There’s shame about the shame. So there’s a tendency to not want to tell someone what’s going on.” But it worked for her. In 2014, after a decade of silence, Lewinsky wrote an essay for Vanity Fair, headlined Shame And Survival . “The night before it was published, a friend gave me a card with an Anaïs Nin quote: ‘And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.’” As a result she was asked to speak at a Forbes conference, and then came the TED invitation. She knew what a big deal TED was and so she employed “a team in London to help me find my authentic voice in public speaking”. It was worth the effort. Nowadays, charities like the Diana Award are queueing up to work with her. (The Diana Award is an enterprise, endorsed by Princes William and Harry, that hopes to “inspire and recognise social action in young people”.) Of course, most bullying victims don’t have such a highfalutin stage as TED upon which to reclaim their identity, but most bullying victims weren’t bullied relentlessly all over the world for years, often by highfalutin people. Lewinsky has advice for bystanders, too: “Don’t bully the bully. It doesn’t move the conversation forward. I see bullying as similar to cutting. People who cut are trying to localise their pain. I think with bullying, people are suffering for myriad reasons and are projecting it. Instead of cutting themselves, they’re cutting someone else.” She knows her advice can sometimes seem hard to stick to, such as when she suggests boycotting unfolding public shaming stories: “Because of the way the algorithm of the internet works, we do have some control. Editors aren’t going to assign stories that aren’t going to get clicks.” But then she confesses that she sometimes clicks on those exciting stories, too. She came up with her most recent endeavour after some teenagers told her how hard it can be to find the right words. They’d see their friends being bullied online and wouldn’t know what to say. “I realised,” she says, “that our brains process images faster than text, which means the fastest way you can help – the least amount of time between someone feeling alone and upset, and feeling just a tiny bit better – is with an image.” And so she pitched an idea to Vodafone. Could she design a keyboard of anti-bullying gifs and emojis for them? “And now you can get them on all carriers,” she says. “Look. Let me show you…” Lewinsky’s new anti‑bullying emojis for Vodafone, inspired by teenagers. Photograph: Vodafone She pulls out her phone and starts to search for them. I remember something we talked about at the start of the interview – her fear of misspeaking and bringing the maelstrom back down upon her. It’s not an irrational anxiety. Formerly shamed people frequently find themselves suddenly reshamed for the original transgression when they least expect it – when social media hears they’ve got a new job, for instance. We tend to relentlessly define people by the worst mistake they ever made. “Somewhat unique about my situation,” Lewinsky says, “is that my narrative is tied to other people’s narratives, people on the public stage. And so my narrative gets pulled into things, based on what other people are doing, even if I do nothing.” Related: The dark side of Guardian comments As it happens, we are speaking the day after Super Tuesday . Twelve US states held primary elections yesterday and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton emerged as frontrunners. I’m assuming this is Lewinsky’s least preferred candidate combination. Donald Trump released a campaign video on Instagram that included a photograph of a young Lewinsky in a beret, smiling at Bill Clinton. It felt like a harbinger – a warning shot. He’d already told NBC’s Today Show, back in December 2015, that he considered Lewinsky “fair game” in his battle against the Clintons. “Are you worried Trump is going to make hay with you?” I ask her. “I’m not going to answer that,” she replies. “How’s this? I’m affected by what happens on the world stage. But I don’t let it deter me. I’m incredibly grateful for the movement I have in my life right now… OK! Found them!” She passes me her phone. There’s a gif on the screen. It’s a big heart with two arms inside it, embracing. The heart shakes. There’s a TV on the restaurant wall. We’re veiled behind a curtain, so I can only make out the vague shape and the colour of what’s being shown. But it’s obvious. It’s the unmistakable yellow blob of Donald Trump, looming down, yelling from a podium. I look back down at Lewinsky’s delightful, sweet-natured gif, shaking away. “It feels like a hug!” she says. “Right?” “I think it looks great,” I say. “It really does feel like a hug.” “Well, thanks!” she says. She mimes a “phew”. Suddenly all her nerviness is gone. She smiles a huge smile and points at the gif on the screen and says, “I worked my little heart out on it.” ',?
'Mazda 3 1.5D car review – ‘It’s a marriage of convenience rather than a love match’ It’s unlikely you’ll feel moved to race anyone at the lights Mazda 3 1.5D: ‘Better equipped than you’d expect at the price point.’ Share on WhatsApp Beware the car that companies buy you because they feel as though they have to; it will come with stupid conditions to make sure you don’t enjoy yourself. That is a generalised view, with no particular relevance to the Mazda 3 1.5D, except that it was devised to look as though it belonged to a mid-range marketing executive and to fit into a low carbon bracket at the same time, which is like wanting a handbag that is chic but will fit your wellies. Now, that is unfair: this looks a lot like the rest in the range, which is to say, slightly sharkish in the exterior styling, but with narrow, elegant features and an air of reliability – a bit like a slim, reasonable shark. It’s hard to imagine, but you’ll know it when you see it. This is a smaller-engined model, but you will only notice that when you try to accelerate: how much you mind depends on how often you do. It’s unlikely you’ll feel moved to race anyone at the lights, but on a motorway it will plough along just fine – it just won’t dart or zip. It’s relatively quiet once you get going, too, which is a relief after the moaning and griping acceleration in the lower gears. It’s a bit like those men who complain incessantly about everything, from their colleagues to their soft furnishings, and it takes you ages to realise that the complaints are actually a masculine display of enjoyment. That is the Mazda all over – I suspect it of genuinely enjoying city driving, with its nose-down, grippy handling, but it would see you in hell before admitting it. I liked, nay, respected the cabin, which was intuitive without being boring: spacious, touch-screeny, not wildly classy in the finish, but better equipped than you’d expect at the price point. Adults could sit happily in the back without looking as though wedged in as part of a kidnap, and the boot is shopping-friendly. The barrier for me would be falling in love, and this is common with fleet cars; since it’s a marriage of convenience brokered by an employer, rather than a love match, there’s always the tendency to play it too straight. This can deliver a car that is perfectly serviceable, but not one whose flaws you would gladly overlook because of its cute chassis or its unexpected poke. You end up without so much a feeling about it as a list of pros and cons, which – in the absence of some startling USP – is never enough to give a car an edge. Mazda 3 1.5D in numbers ',?
'Search engines EU wants Google, Microsoft to be more transparent about ads in search results The European Union’s digital chief says he is worried about how clear some search engines are when displaying advertisements in search results Facebook, Google and Amazon lobbied hard against new rules for online platforms and what they saw as an anti-American protectionist backlash. Photograph: Boris Roessler/EPA Reuters Friday 15 April 2016 17.14 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 17.40 EDT Share on WhatsApp The European Union’s digital chief wants search engines such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft’s Bing to be more transparent about advertising in web search results but ruled out a separate law for web platforms. European Commission vice-president Andrus Ansip, who is overseeing a wide-ranging inquiry into how web platforms conduct their business, said on Friday the EU executive would not take a horizontal approach to regulating online services. “We will take a problem-driven approach,” Ansip said. “It’s practically impossible to regulate all the platforms with one really good single solution.” Related: Do Google’s ’unprofessional hair’ results show it is racist? That will come as a relief to the web industry, dominated mainly by big US tech firms such as Facebook , Google and Amazon, who lobbied hard against new rules for online platforms and what they saw as an anti-American protectionist backlash. “We praise the commission for understanding that a horizontal measure for all platforms is practically impossible,” said Jakob Kucharczyk, director of the Computer & Communications Industry Association which represents the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon. “While a lot of online platforms enable economic growth, their business models differ widely.“ However Ansip said he was worried about how transparent some search engines are when displaying ads in search results. The Commission is also looking into the transparency of paid-for reviews as well as the conditions of use of services such as Google Maps, Apple Inc’s IoS mobile operating system and Google’s Android. “Maybe it’s not too much to ask for more transparency talking about search engines,” Ansip said. The former Estonian prime minister also poured cold water on the idea that the Commission would make search engines pay to display snippets of news articles, dubbed the “Google tax”, as part of its EU copyright law reform due later this year. The EU executive is looking into making rules on taking down illegal content clearer and more effective without making hosting websites such as YouTube directly liable. “Now musicians ask, please, take it down and keep it down,” Ansip said. “We want to make those rules more clear.“ But the Commission will not change a provision where websites such as Amazon, eBay and Google’s YouTube are not held liable for illegal content that is uploaded on to their systems. They do, however, have a responsibility to take it down once they are notified of it. The Commission will publish a communication detailing its plans on web platforms in June. ',?
'Facebook Facebook’s ’spammy’ chatbots must improve - and fast Company’s new Messenger chatbot prompts nonsensical answers and unrelenting spam, which risks tipping users over the edge Beta or not, irritating users and answering with rubbish is an immediate turn-off that could ruin chatbots for everyone. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP Thursday 14 April 2016 07.10 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 07.11 EDT Share on WhatsApp If bots are the new apps, we’re in for a bombardment of spam that could force you into blocking brands, bots and services, if Facebook’s new chatbots are anything to go by. In trying out the new bots , the launch of which Facebook’s head of messaging David Marcus called “the first day of a new era”, it’s obvious that Facebook and its partners, including news organisations such as CNN and the Wall Street Journal, need to learn a few things, and fast. User intrigue over what a chatbot can actually do quickly turned into loathing, once they began being spammed through a channel hitherto restricted to personal messages from people they care about. While users might put up with spam on a social network, messaging systems are more akin to a phone call or SMS, where sender is essentially shouting in the recipients face “talk to me now”. That’s fine if it’s a select friend that you might want to actually talk to, but if it’s a brand you’re very unsure about, it quickly grates. The trouble begins when you realise you don’t know how do you stop the messages. It’s a bot, so perhaps asking it to unsubscribe in natural language should do it? Not so for the CNN bot at least. — Olivia Solon (@oliviasolon) April 13, 2016 My CNN bot already feels a little bit spammy. Cute emoticons don’t really cut it in this case... pic.twitter.com/9EY7gBwyMQ As it turns out a user has to simply send the word “unsubscribe” without any other text to prompt the subscription settings for the CNN bot. The Wall Street Journal bot was a bit more intelligent. Sending it the word “stop”, as a UK user attempting to unsubscribe from premium-rate SMS messages has learned, spawned the bot’s alert preferences. Sadly unsubscribing did little to stop the barrage of messages, forcing users, including myself, into actively blocking the WSJ bot to stop the spam. ',?
'Apple Apple and FBI to clash again in Congress over encryption Top Apple lawyer and FBI executive will testify before lawmakers as heated debate over law enforcement access to encrypted devices continues The high-profile clash between Apple and the FBI over the now closed case of San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone raised encryption to a national debate. Photograph: Steven Senne/AP Reuters Thursday 14 April 2016 18.34 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 19.57 EDT Share on WhatsApp Apple and the FBI will return to Congress on April 19 to testify before lawmakers about their heated disagreement over law enforcement access to encrypted devices, a congressional committee announced on Thursday. Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and Amy Hess, executive assistant director for science and technology at the FBI , will testify on separate panels before a house energy and commerce subcommittee on Tuesday, in addition to other law enforcement officials and technology experts. FBI director James Comey appeared before a separate congressional committee last month to defend his agency’s pursuit of a court order to compel Apple’s assistance in unlocking an iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. Sewell also testified at that hearing. The FBI has since abandoned the San Bernardino case , a surprising development that came after a still-secret third party helped the government hack into the iPhone. Related: FBI paid professional hackers to gain access to San Bernardino iPhone – report But the US justice department redoubled its efforts last week to use the courts to force Apple’s cooperation in cracking encrypted iPhones by announcing plans to continue with an appeal in an unrelated New York drug case . Other witnesses appearing include Thomas Galati, chief of the New York police department’s intelligence bureau; Charles Cohen, commander of the Indiana Internet crimes against children task force; and Matthew Blaze, a professor and computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania. “The encryption debate is an important one and it is imperative for the public to be engaged,” said energy and commerce committee chairman Fred Upton. “There’s a delicate balance between the need for strong, secure, and effective encryption and solutions that permit law enforcement to protect the American people.” Earlier this week, two US. senators released draft legislation that would empower courts to order technology companies to hand over data “in an intelligible format,” even if encryption has rendered that data inaccessible to anyone other than the owner. Security researchers and civil liberties advocates say the bill amounts to a ban on strong encryption, which is necessary to keep malicious hackers at bay and protect the overall security of the internet.

I have super-powerful Alienware laptop but there is only one HDMI port, and it doesn’t like running HDMI and anything else simultaneously. I am wondering if I should build a PC that will have video cards and ports to support three screens and have a separate, dedicated travel laptop. What do you think? I am considering an office set up like Bill Gates had in 2006 . I believe this will greatly improve my efficiency. Cameron I am strongly in favour of having separate desktop and laptop PCs, though it’s perfectly possible to use a laptop or tablet to do both jobs. For example, you can use something like a Microsoft Surface Pro as a desktop PC, if you set it up with a docking station, an external keyboard and mouse, and two or three separate monitors. Brett Gilbertson provides an example. Desktop tower systems have some advantages, however Towers can use faster, hotter, cheaper processors, and performance won’t be throttled to prevent overheating, as it is in ultra-thin laptops. Tower systems are easier to repair and/or upgrade: you can add more memory, a faster graphics card, bigger hard drives and screens, and so on. And as I’ve said before , desktop PCs have much better ergonomics than laptops, so they are better for your long-term health. You can ameliorate the ergonomic problems by using docks and external peripherals, as mentioned above. However, it’s usually cheaper to buy both a fast desktop PC and a usable ultraportable than to buy a fast ultraportable plus the dock and other peripherals. Of course, it really depends on the kind of computing you do, and where you do it. If you spend most of your time at your desk, and if you do processor-intensive tasks such as video editing, then you should spend as much as you can on a desktop and buy a low-end laptop or 2-in-1 for word processing, web browsing and email on the move. If you spend most of your time away from your desk, then you may want to spend more of your budget on a better laptop. Multiple monitors People are usually more productive if they have more screen area available, and many people prefer to have two or – like Bill Gates – three monitors. You can work on the centre screen, use a second screen for background research, and keep the third screen for things that update continuously, such as email and messaging services. Some gamers like to have three screens that function as a single widescreen, to provide a semi-surround effect. This works well with flight simulators and racing games, for example. One of the problems with multi-monitor set-ups is that almost everyone seems to have a different system. Some people just use different ports to support different screens – HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort, VGA, USB etc. Some people buy graphics cards that support two or more monitors. Some (mostly gamers) buy or build PCs that have more than one graphics card. Some buy integrated three-screen monitors like the Zenview Trio from Digital Tigers. Today, however, I suspect the simplest idea is to attach a USB 3.0 docking station to a laptop or, less commonly, a desktop PC. You drive the main external display from the HDMI port in the usual way, then use the USB 3.0 hub to drive two extra screens. This is the approach I described last year in How can I add two external monitors to my laptop? This works well for normal office and productivity software, which uses 2D graphics. It’s not suitable for 3D graphics purposes, such as gaming. Any modern PC or graphics card should be able to handle multiple screens showing documents, spreadsheets, browser windows and so on. Fast-action 3D graphics with lighting and texture effects are a different matter. With some games, just handling one screen can be a problem. Pick a card If you need a gaming rig, you should look elsewhere for advice: I don’t know enough about the topic. Once you have a rough idea of what you want, you can post your proposed build at PC Part Picker and ask for advice. However, for multiscreen gaming, you will need a powerful graphics card with 3GB or preferably 4GB of memory, such as a GeForce GTX 960 or GTX 970. Both of these cards have three DisplayPorts, as well as HDMI and DVI ports. All modern monitors have DisplayPort connections, and that’s the one to use if you have a choice. Note that you have to be careful when choosing multi-port graphics cards. A card that offers five ports for convenience may only support two monitors. If you plug in a third, it will come up with a blank screen, or a duplicate of one of the first two screens. However, some cards can support three screens – such as the EVGA GeForce GT 740 – and some can support four, such as the GeForce GTX 960 and GTX 970. The GeForce website has a configuration tool . If you select your GPU, it will tell you the maximum number of displays, the resolutions supported, and the connector diagrams. Eliminating wires It’s a standard feature of desktop PCs that they end up with “a spaghetti junction of wires”. There may be cables to connect the mouse, keyboard, one or more screens, loudspeakers, an internet router, and one or more external hard drives. Most devices need a power cable as well. Fortunately, most wiring is usually out of sight, except when you’re under your desk. There’s really not much you can do, beyond using wireless connections for the keyboard, mouse and printer. There are lots of systems that provide wireless connections to monitors, including Intel’s WiDi , which was launched a decade ago and has never really taken off. The Wi-Fi Alliance – which standardised IEEE 802.11 as Wi-Fi – has done a similar job with wireless screens, and its Miracast system is widely supported (except by Apple). There are now about 5,000 certified Miracast products , but the bulk of them are smartphones (1,066) or televisions and set-top boxes (3,438). In other words, you can probably use a smartphone to display content on a TV set, but it’s not a very attractive solution for driving high-resolution PC monitors. You’d probably have to buy an adapter for each screen, and there are latency and connection issues. You might be able to save a cable by using products that match the DisplayPort 1.2 (or later) specification, which allows you to daisy-chain screens. Unfortunately, this would greatly restrict your choice of monitors. You’d need to buy ones with two DisplayPort 1.2-compatible connectors, one in and one out. It would be simpler to use a DisplayPort hub to support three monitors, but you might as well buy a more flexible USB 3.0 docking station instead. You’d probably be better off using sheaths, sleeves or other cable tidying systems to combine two or more thin wires into one fat cable. These work until you start to change or rearrange things ...

'European parliament approves tougher data privacy rules ‘Groundbreaking’ changes strengthen EU privacy protections, enshrine right to be forgotten and give regulators wide-reaching powers Former vice-president of the European commission Viviane Reding hailed the move as a ‘historic day for Europe’. Photograph: Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images Thursday 14 April 2016 08.22 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 08.23 EDT Share on WhatsApp The European parliament has voted through tougher rules on data protection, aimed at boosting privacy and giving authorities greater powers to take action against companies that breach the rules. The rules, including the much-needed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), were four years in the making and form the new backbone of laws for data regulators to pursue companies with heavy fines – as much as 4% of annual turnover for global companies – for incidents such as data breaches, which have become increasingly common. Viviane Reding, MEP and former vice-president of the European commission who proposed the changes in 2012, said: “This is a historic day for Europe. This reform will restore trust in digital services today, thereby reigniting the engine for growth tomorrow. “There can be no freedom without security, and no security without freedom. Today’s concomitant adoption of these three legislations sends a strong signal that national security and data protection can and must go hand in hand.” Replacing the patchwork of national rules The new data privacy laws comprise of the GDPR, which governs the use and privacy of EU citizens’ data, and the Data Protection Directive, which governs the use of EU citizens’ data by law enforcement. Together they aim to create strong data protection law for Europe’s 500 million citizens; streamline legislation between the 28 member states pushing a digital single market and boost police and security cooperation. It is due to replace the outdated patchwork of national rules that have only allowed for small fines in cases of violation. Phil Lee, a data protection partner at Fieldfisher, said: “Is this law ground-breaking? Absolutely. Europe has created the notions of a ‘right to be forgotten’ and of ‘data portability’, and created fines for data breaches that are on a scale equivalent to fines for antitrust violations. No other region has done that before. “Whatever else may be said about it, the simple fact is that the global standard for data protection will now be dictated by European rules.” The new laws have already proved controversial with companies wishing to operate with EU citizens’ data, placing an administrative burden on some, including those based outside of Europe. William Long, a partner at Sidley Austin, said: “Organisations should be under no doubt that now is the time to start the process for ensuring privacy compliance with the regulations. Importantly, companies outside of Europe, such as those in the US who offer goods and services to Europeans, will fall under the scope of this legislation and will face the same penalties for non-compliance.” ePrivacy Directive next The next step in strengthening of data regulation across the EU is an overhaul of the ePrivacy Directive, which will now commence in earnest, to bring it inline with the changes laid out in the GDPR. The European parliament also voted through the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR), which aims to aid law enforcement in tracking people’s movement across Europe. EC’s first vice-president Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip, and commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Věra Jourová, said: “These new rules come at a time when improved cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime is more necessary than ever, as shown by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels.” Reding added: “Faced with the transnational nature of the digital revolution and the fight against terror, EU-wide rules are the only solution to our problems. “PNR is an important tool to track terrorists flying in and out of Europe in a much wider toolkit, which should also include the systematic sharing of information in all EU databases.” ',?
'Pinterest Protesters clang pots and pangs at the fundraisers. Photograph: The Guardian “They sell you a dream at startups – the ping-pong, the perks – so they can pull 80 hours out of you,” said Quirk, a 26-year-old software engineer. “But in reality the venture capitalists control all the capital, all the labor, and all the decisions, so yeah, it feels great protesting one.” Nearly 200 Bernie Sanders supporters gathered last night with pots and pans outside Shervin Pishevar’s star-studded Clinton fundraiser, co-hosted by George and Amal Clooney. The Sanders supporters argued corporate interests were buying Clinton that night – tickets for Pishevar’s dinner started at $33,400 (for a seat at the Fairmont hotel) and went up to $353,400 (for a seat at his house). Most of those in the streets were young, and many were in tech. “Tech workers are workers, no matter how much money they make. The investors are what’s wrong in this city,” said 24-year-old Tom Sliwowski, one of the Bay Area Movement For Bernie organizers and a PhD student at Berkeley. “Tech workers are the face of gentrification, but they’re not the cause. “Also, let’s be honest, you can’t blame them for ruining the Mission when Palo Alto is so boring.” Massive protests outside Democratic fundraisers are rare in San Francisco , where most popular ire is directed at conservative events at South Bay estates. No major rallies rocked Nob Hill when Pishevar hosted Barack Obama for a fundraiser during his re-election campaign. Related: Millennials ’heart’ Bernie Sanders: why the young and hip are #FeelingtheBern But today there’s a growing rift in the city, which may influence the 7 June Democratic primary. Among the tech community, as wealth consolidates, many young workers lured to town with images of striking it rich have been confronted by an increasingly depressing startup environment. Bill Sandberg, a 29-year-old protester, said he had just been laid off from Zedo, an ad tech startup: “Bernie’s actually for the people. Hillary’s just bought and sold.” Sanders has won over at least this set of tech workers. He’s raised $3.2m to Clinton’s $1.5m in the tech sector since February, according to the independent election data site CrowdPac . Around the state, Clinton’s still holds a lead, but Sanders is gaining. He has 39.3% of the vote to Clinton’s 48.8%, according to poll averages . The Sanders campaign used outrage over Pishevar’s event to push for fundraising last night, asking for “small-dollar” donations that would match the price tag of a seat at the fundraiser. “Now, you know where this campaign stands on George Clooney. YUGE fans,” campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote supporters. “But a political contribution of $353,000?!??! That’s just an obscene amount of money.” ',?
'Movies AMC abandons plan for texting-friendly theaters after wave of backlash Two days after head of AMC Theatres mulled openly about allowing texting in movie theaters, he says he’s heard audience opinion ‘loud and clear’ Peace has been restored to the movie-going galaxy. Photograph: Jani Bryson/Getty Images Associated Press in Los Angeles Friday 15 April 2016 16.38 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 17.42 EDT Share on WhatsApp Oops. The idea lasted about as long as a Snapchat text: the head of AMC Theatres mulled openly about creating texting-friendly movie theaters to appeal to smartphone-addicted youngsters. Two days later, after a backlash on social media, the company says it’s leaving the idea on “the cutting room floor”. Adam Aron, who became CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings in December, told Variety magazine for a story Wednesday that the company would consider allowing cellphone use in some theaters to appeal to millennials. Related: Texting in movie theaters? Bring it on | Amber Jamieson “When you tell a 22-year-old to ‘Turn off the phone, don’t ruin the movie,’ they hear ‘Please cut off your left arm above the elbow.’ You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s not how they live their life,” he said. That’s when the Twitter-verse unleashed a torrent of criticism on the plan. “AMC Theaters want to allow texting in movie theaters. In other news, I’ll never go to AMC Theaters ever again,” tweeted Fox News reporter Jake Hamilton. Blogger Perez Hilton tweeted the plan made sense “because everything is the worst”. Lucasfilm story executive Pablo Hidalgo mulled a day when he “brings enormous durian fruit to AMC theater; live-tweets and periscopes self eating it while movie plays”. Before the spasmic social media outrage continued much longer, AMC released a statement from Aron early Friday saying he had “instantaneously” reversed his thinking. “With your advice in hand, there will be NO TEXTING ALLOWED in any of the auditoriums at AMC Theatres. Not today, not tomorrow and not for the foreseeable future,” he said. “Unlike the many AMC advancements that you have applauded, we have heard loud and clear that this is a concept our audience does not want.” Peace was restored to the movie-going galaxy. “I love when rational thought wins out,” tweeted Holly Overton. “Thanks (at)amctheaters for respecting moviegoers!” “[Y]ay! Amc is literally the only theater chain in my area, so I’m relieved,” tweeted Benjy Monteagudo. And some had moved on to the next issue: the lengthy ads before a movie plays. “OK guys we did it,” tweeted Brian Collins. “Now let’s yell at them for 3 days re: their 22 minute trailer/concession ad before the movie.” ',?

Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters Reuters Friday 15 April 2016 15.21 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 15.54 EDT Share on WhatsApp A US-based online publishing platform, Medium , has been blocked in China, according to users and tests by Reuters, the latest service to apparently be affected as Beijing exerts greater control over the internet. Medium, which allows users, including companies and media outlets, to post blogs that readers can annotate, has been inaccessible since at least early this week, according to internet users in China and tests by Reuters using tools developed by anti-censorship watchdog GreatFire.org. It was not immediately apparent why Medium was blocked. China’s internet regulator did not respond to a faxed request for comment. San Francisco-based Medium did not respond to emailed questions outside normal US working hours. Last week, a Medium post about the Panama Papers leak, detailing the offshore wealth of various countries’ leaders and their relatives, including China’s, was widely shared on Chinese social media. China has moved to limit access to coverage of the matter and has censored online reports about it. Also last week, Medium said more than a dozen media outlets would start publishing on its site, an arrangement that would have allowed publications whose websites are blocked in China to reach users in the country. If confirmed, Medium would join a range of sites already blocked in China, including the blogging platforms WordPress and Google’s Blogger. The websites of several major media outlets are also blocked, including those of the Economist and Time, which both become inaccessible last week after they ran articles critical of President Xi Jinping. Under Xi, the government has tightened control on the internet and sought to codify that policy in the law. Officials say internet restrictions are needed to ensure security in the face of rising threats, such as terrorism. Foreign governments and business groups have pointed to restrictions on the Internet as a broader trade issue. On Friday, a US business lobby said internet restrictions were hampering business and that the free flow of information was critical to China’s effort to promote innovation. ',?
'Stage Brunel’s Thames tunnel (and accidental brothel) becomes new arts space The entrance hall to Brunel’s 19th-century tunnel under the Thames has been turned into a unique auditorium, complete with the rumble of Tube trains Scorched with soot … the Grand Entrance Hall, London, part of the Brunel Museum. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex shutterstock Friday 15 April 2016 06.47 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 10.30 EDT Share on WhatsApp The engineers Marc and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel would have approved, the director of the Brunel Museum Robert Hulse reflected, as he removed the legs from a Bechstein grand piano and helped wrestle it down a twisting staircase into the massive iron shaft they sank into the banks of the Thames 190 years ago. Pinterest The entrance to the Grand Entrance Hall. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX/Shutterstock The space they designed as their Grand Entrance Hall, which in the early 19th century led the way down to an engineering feat described as the eighth wonder of the world – the first ever road tunnel under a river – has now become one of the capital’s most dramatic performance spaces . It has been fitted with lighting and sound equipment, but left with the scarred walls where the Brunels’ original staircase was ripped out, still scorched with soot from the years it spent as a ventilation shaft for steam trains running through the tunnel. The newly created access is via a ramp around the outside of the shaft, then a new oak and steel staircase designed by Jerry Tate of Tate Harmer. He said they tried to keep the space as raw as possible, preserving every possible scrap of the Brunels’ work, now Grade II* listed. High up on the wall, there is a little barred entrance passage which has its own place in engineering history: when there was a collapse during the construction, the river burst through the half-excavated tunnel and up the shaft, killing six men. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then a teenager, was washed so high up the shaft that a foreman dragged him out of the water by his coat collar. He was more dead than alive, but survived to build marvels including the Great Western Railway, the Clifton suspension bridge and the SS Great Britain. It turns out that their enormous shaft, 50 feet (15m) in diameter and 50ft deep, built on land and allowed to sink into the ground under its own weight – “a giant pastry cutter”, Hulse said – has a superb acoustic. The piano and the two voices of singers from Popup Opera will give two performances of Bellini’s I Capuleti e i Montecchi there next week. Performances will have regular interesting rumbling noises though: London Overground trains still run through the Brunel tunnels, the oldest part of the London Transport network. “We specialise in performing in unusual spaces,” Popup Opera founder Clementine Lovell said, “and as soon as we saw this we knew it was for us.” ',?
'Radiohead Radiohead have not yet decided whether to stream new album, says man from their management firm Brian Message of Courtyard Management says he is ‘praying every night’ that the band decide to put their next record on Spotify Thom Yorke … Still making his mind up. Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images Friday 15 April 2016 06.39 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 08.27 EDT Share on WhatsApp Radiohead have still not decided whether to allow their new album to be streamed on Spotify. Speaking at the Wanstead Tap cafe in London on Thursday night, Brian Message – of the band’s management company, Courtyard Management – said he’s “praying every night” that lead singer Thom Yorke lets Spotify have the album, but a final decision is yet to be made. As previously reported , Message told the audience of just 30 people that the new album would be released in June. He refused to reveal its name, but billled the album as “something that will probably make many of us go, ‘Wow!’”. He continued: “There’s nothing out there right now that sounds anything like this. And for some people that will be a good thing and for others that probably won’t.” Related: Radiohead manager reported saying new album will arrive in June However, the precise form of its release remains uncertain. “I’m looking forward to the day it does come out,” Message said. “And I hope – I really hope – it does come out on streaming services. To say that’s been answered, believe me it hasn’t, but I’m praying every night that it does.” The news is unsurprising in some respects. Yorke has been vocal in his criticism of streaming for years, once calling Spotify “ the last desperate fart of a dying corpse ”. But Message insisted Yorke’s criticism was largely down to the fact streaming’s potential had yet to be realised. “There should be 200 million-plus paying subscribers [on streaming sites], but there aren’t. So when you’re stuck in the trenches and there are still under 100 million subscribers, it’s hard [to see the benefits of streaming].” Message used much of his talk to criticise the secondary ticketing market, through which companies buy up gig tickets at normal value and sell them on at vastly inflated prices. The band have tried to stop this happening on their forthcoming European tour by limiting tickets to two per person and saying buyers must be named on tickets and supply ID when they arrive at venues. But apparently that has not stopped secondary sellers from trying to get in on the market for the shows, for which tickets sold out in minutes . “Viagogo had people buying or repeatedly trying to get hold of tickets and they managed to get 19 across each of the three nights at the Roundhouse,” Message said. “They’ve since sold them for £1,000 each. So what’ll happen on those nights is a Viagogo employee will walk into the venue with another person pretending to be their friend. Related: Gone in 20 minutes: Radiohead tickets for the Roundhouse, an impossible mission “You can try to limit the secondary ticketing market as much as we have, but the next step is you only being able to buy one ticket per transaction. And that’d probably be a bit of a lonely, strange gig: 3,000 singles, all in the same room, all mostly men. It’d be a bit weird.” Message, whose company, ATC, also manages Nick Cave and PJ Harvey, said his own embrace of technology was still limited. “We’ve been tap dancing around with a number of our acts with virtual reality for years, and there’s a lot of people super excited about it. Samsung are bringing out new things with it [all the time]. But I’m personally still struggling with where it’s at as a format. “What I love about streaming is if you’re a kid, with your headphones in, it’s cool. On the bus or the tube, it ticks a load of boxes, you can go into your own world. But the concept of sitting on a bus with your fucking VR headset on? Maybe I’m just getting too old.” Initial reports, the Guardian’s included, described Message as Radiohead’s manager. In fact, he is a partner in Courtyard Management, with Radiohead’s affairs being handled by Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge. Radiohead have stated that his quotes should not be taken as being on behalf of the group. This story was amended on 15 April. Brian Message is a partner in Radiohead’s management company rather than their manager. ',?
'Scams Sim-swap fraud claims another mobile banking victim Chris Sims’ account emptied and loan for £8,000 taken out as fraudsters continue to exploit way banks use customers’ mobiles Chris Sims, still shocked at having his bank account emptied and a loan taken out in his name. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer Share on WhatsApp Chris Sims was sitting in his Nottingham home a fortnight ago when his iPhone, on the EE network, suddenly stopped working. Within 75 minutes the fraudsters who had hijacked his phone had, through his online banking app, emptied his bank account of £1,200 and applied for an £8,000 loan in his name. But Sims is just the latest victim of a financial scam that is sweeping Britain: sim-swap fraud. When Sims rang EE, it soon emerged that someone posing as his wife had managed to persuade the mobile network to activate a new sim card – in effect giving the fraudsters control of his mobile number. The crooks were then able to reset all his mobile banking passwords, using his phone as identity, and the passwords being sent to the phone. Related: Mobile banking in the spotlight as fraudsters pull £6,000 sting The mobile phone companies say they first started seeing this sort of fraud in late 2015, and admit it is growing rapidly. Sims says that when he contacted his bank, Halifax, the call centre told him it is handling hundreds of sim scams every day, making it the fastest growing fraud in the country – although Halifax later disputed this figure. It appears that fraudsters have identified a significant vulnerability in the way banks are using their customers’ mobiles to identify them – and exploiting it to the max. “One minute I’m wondering why my phone won’t work, and less than two hours later my bank account has been emptied and I have an £8,000 loan,” says a still shocked Sims. “What has really annoyed me is EE’s attitude. It told me it has recordings of two calls where the fraudster tried to take over my account but failed the security questions. You’d think this might have set alarm bells ringing, but it didn’t. Then, on the third attempt, they were happy to cancel my sim. I have asked to hear this call but EE mysteriously didn’t record it, which I find very convenient.” He says he has no idea why his phone was targeted. It is actually on a shared account in his wife’s name, although he pays the monthly bill from his bank account. Her phone worked as normal. “They appear to have used the phone to tell Halifax that I had forgotten all my online bank settings. When my settings were reset, the bank sent notification to my phone – which of course, went to the fraudsters. If your bank’s security is only as good as EE’s then God help us all. I’ve been contacted by another woman who this has happened to twice. I won’t be using mobile banking again,” Sims says. EE said it has recordings of two calls where the fraudster failed security. You’d think this would set bells ringing Chris Sims EE says it has “strict policies and procedures in place to prevent fraudulent activity and unauthorised access”. It adds: “All requests to make account changes, including swapping a sim, require the person to provide a range of details to verify their identity, and in this case the correct password was given. While we continue to improve defences against this type of fraud, customers should use unique and strong passwords for each of their accounts and contact their network provider, their bank and the authorities immediately if they notice any issues.” Before a sim can be cancelled and reissued, the mobile phone network will ask a number of security questions, which only the phone owner should know the answer to. This suggests that fraudsters have already gathered a considerable amount of information on their victim. The mobile phone companies say these details may have been hoovered up from social media accounts such as Facebook, or possibly bought on the “dark web”. But they also admit that they and the banks need to do more to fight this new menace. Halifax tells us that it “ invests heavily in detection systems to ensure robust controls are in place. To protect our customers we are working with industry and network providers on a number of initiatives, including sim-swapping”.It adds: “We are sorry to hear that on this occasion Mr Sims fell victim to fraudsters who were able to remove funds from his account following a sim-swap. Where a customer is a victim of fraud we look to refund, provided the customer has taken reasonable steps to keep their own security information safe. As such, as soon as Mr Sims notified us of the fraud, we immediately refunded the money he had lost.” Related: Met chief suggests banks should not refund online fraud victims Guardian Money has also recently reported on the case of John Ellard from Hertford whose Nationwide account was emptied of £6,000 after fraudsters apparently took over his O2 mobile account. Our earliest case of a fraudster using a victim’s mobile to access their bank account was in September last year, when we featured Emma Franks who had £1,500 taken after thieves took over her Vodafone account. Someone had reported her sim card water-damaged, and requested a replacement. ',?
'Hacking Journalist gets two-year sentence for helping Anonymous hack LA Times Matthew Keys was convicted of giving login credentials to the hacking group, in a decision civil liberties group calls ‘prosecutorial discretion run amok’ Matthew Keys, right, pictured with his attorney in 2013. Keys said the case was a ‘very heavy-handed prosecution’. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP Wednesday 13 April 2016 20.04 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 10.38 EDT Share on WhatsApp Matthew Keys, a journalist found guilty of conspiring with hacking group Anonymous to break into the Los Angeles Times website, was sentenced to two years in prison on Wednesday in a case that has sparked national debate about how the US prosecutes hacking offenses. Keys, who was found guilty of three criminal counts in October , was convicted of giving Anonymous login credentials to the computer system of the Tribune Company, which owns the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Baltimore Sun and other media companies. Prosecutors alleged that a hacker used information Keys provided to change the headline of a 2010 Times story. KTXL-TV, a Tribune-owned Fox affiliate in Sacramento, had previously fired Keys, and the US attorney’s office asserted that the incident was payback by a disgruntled former employee. Related: Anti-Trump campaign sparks civil war among Anonymous hackers Soon after a judge announced the sentence in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday, Keys, who has a large social media following, tweeted that he was pushing forward with an appeal, adding: “[W]e’re not only going to work to reverse the conviction but try to change this absurd computer law, as best we can.” Reached by phone after the decision, Keys added, “It’s fairly common knowledge at this point that this was a very heavy-handed prosecution.” In a short post on Medium before the hearing, Keys wrote, “I hope that our combined efforts help bring about positive change to rules and regulations that govern our online conduct.” He further argued that prosecutors have overly broad discretion to bring excessively punitive terrorism charges against people for minor offenses online. “Until the law catches up with the times, there’s no doubt that prosecutors will do it again,” he wrote. Keys, now 29, was fired from his job as a social media editor at Reuters news agency when prosecutors first filed charges in 2013. He has continued reporting as his case has moved forward. The Electronic Frontier Foundation , a not-for-profit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world, has argued that Keys’s case was an example of “prosecutorial discretion run amok”, criticizing the controversial federal anti-hacking statute known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. “This case underscores how computer crimes are prosecuted much more harshly than analogous crimes in the physical world,” the EFF wrote after he was convicted. In the interview on Wednesday, Keys said he hoped his appeal would result in reforms. “We have a real shot of narrowing the applicability of the law so that this doesn’t happen to anybody else.” Regarding assertions that his crimes constituted terrorist acts , he added, “I think that anybody who has met me, anybody that’s followed my work would highly dispute that.” “I didn’t ask for this fight, this fight came at my door,” he continued. “It was an opportunistic prosecutor that seized the moment.” Keys said he was hopeful that his attorneys could fight the conviction and sentence, saying he intends to keep practicing journalism. “Being able to continue working is very important to me. I’m not going away soon.” Federal officials praised the sentencing in statements after the hearing. “This sentence serves as a warning that those who engage in this type of behavior face harsh penalties,” Tom Osborne, the FBI’s assistant special agent in charge, said in a statement. US attorney Benjamin Wagner added, “Although he did no lasting damage, Keys did interfere with the business of news organizations, and caused the Tribune Company to spend thousands of dollars protecting its servers. Those who use the internet to carry out personal vendettas against former employers should know that there are consequences for such conduct.” ',?
'iPhone 5C FBI paid professional hackers to gain access to San Bernardino iPhone – report Hackers reportedly supply zero-day exploit to allow US law enforcement entry to device, which may put older iPhones at risk of cyber criminals Should the iPhone 5C hack bought by the FBI be sold or passed onto cybercriminals, millions of older iPhones could be left vulnerable to hacking. Photograph: Rex/Zuma Share on WhatsApp The FBI reportedly bought a previously unknown security bug from a group of professional hackers to gain entry to the San Bernardino iPhone 5C, according to the Washington Post . The report suggests hackers supplied at least one so-called zero-day flaw in the iPhone 5C’s security that allowed the FBI to circumvent the lockscreen and automatic wipe feature that kicks in after 10 wrong passcode entries. The hack meant the FBI dropped its attempt to force Apple to create software to unlock the iPhone 5C , which the company said would put all iPhones at risk. The FBI has already clarified that the hack bought for a one-time-fee cannot break into newer iPhones , including the iPhone 5S or later, but the hack could affect any iPhone 5C or older, including the iPhone 5 and 4S. The hackers are said to be professional security experts who probe software, devices and services to find vulnerabilities that they can exploit. They then sell the bugs to governments and third-parties, including those who make surveillance tools similar to the software exposed during a data breach of Italian firm Hacking Team . The security bugs are not disclosed to the makers of the software or hardware, in this case Apple, because they only retain value while functional. The US government has yet to decide whether it will disclose the vulnerability to Apple , but its hand may be forced if it is required to disclose the information in a criminal case under the rules of discovery. It is unknown how the hack operates or whether the hackers sold the flaw to any other agencies or third-parties, but if it is not disclosed to and fixed by Apple, it could leave anyone with an iPhone without a fingerprint sensor at risk of having their smartphone hacked.

'China China tech companies pledge to tackle content that promotes terrorism The companies promise to ‘handle in a timely way terror-related harmful, illegal information, create a clear internet space and maintain social stability’ The companies which have signed up include Baidu Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, JD.com and Sina Corp. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images Reuters Tuesday 12 April 2016 13.49 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 13.52 EDT Share on WhatsApp Twenty-five Chinese technology companies have signed a pledge to counter images and information online that promote terrorism, the internet regulator said on Tuesday, months after China passed a controversial new anti-terrorism law . The Cyberspace Administration of China said the companies had promised to “handle in a timely way terror-related harmful, illegal information, create a clear internet space and maintain social stability”. The companies which have signed up include Baidu Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, JD.com and Sina Corp, the regulator said. Tencent, Alibaba, JD.com and Sina did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Baidu spokesman declined to comment. The regulator said that more than 25,000 posts, 4,000 videos and 200 accounts had been removed from the internet so far this year that involve illegal, terror-related content. China passed the anti-terrorism law in December. Among other things, it requires technology firms to help decrypt information and cooperate with the government in fighting terrorism. Critics say China uses its counter-terror and national security regulations to quell free speech. Under President Xi Jinping, the government has implemented an unprecedented tightening of internet controls and sought to codify the policy within the law. China has rebuffed the criticism of the law, saying it is simply doing what western nations already do in asking technology firms to help fight terror. The law has caused particular unease in western capitals as it codifies sweeping powers for the government to combat perceived threats. China says it faces a serious threat from groups such as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which operates in China’s restive far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where hundreds have died in violence in recent years. Rights groups and many foreign experts though say China has never presented any convincing evidence to prove ETIM exists as a cohesive, well-organised group capable of the kinds of attacks China blames it for.

'Data and computer security Philippine electoral records breached in ’largest ever’ government hack Almost 55 million Filipinos are at risk of cybercrime after a database was stolen from Comelec, the country’s electoral commission A woman looks at a ballot paper during mid-term elections in Manila on May 13, 2013. Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images Monday 11 April 2016 07.03 EDT Last modified on Monday 11 April 2016 10.20 EDT Share on WhatsApp The personal information of more than 50 million Filipinos has been exposed in a breach of the Philippine electoral commission. According to security researchers at Trend Micro , the hack contains a huge amount of very sensitive personal data, including the fingerprints of 15.8 million individuals and passport numbers and expiry dates of 1.3 million overseas voters. The website of the Commission on Elections, Comelec, was initially hacked on March 27 , by a group identifying itself as Anonymous Philippines, the local fork of the wider hacker collective. The homepage was defaced with a message accusing Comelec of not doing enough to ensure the security of voting machines used in the country’s upcoming election. “One of the processes by which people exercise their sovereignty is through voting in an election,” the message read. “But what happens when the electoral process is so mired with questions and controversies? Can the government still guarantee that the sovereignty of the people is upheld?” The same day, a different but related group, LulzSec Pilipinas, posted an online link to what it claimed was the entire database of Comelec. The 338GB database contains 75.3m individual entries on the electoral register, with 54.28m of them not tagged as disapproved – about the same number as the 54.36 million registered voters in the Philippines. That makes this hack potentially the “biggest government related data breach in history”, according to Trend Micro, “surpassing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) hack last 2015 that leaked PII, including fingerprints and social security numbers (SSN) of 20 million US citizens.” It even exceeds last week’s record-breaking release of personal information from the Turkish citizenship database, which contained records on 49 million people, the population of half the country. Trend Micro warns that the Philippine hack leaves citizens open to risk from crime. “Cybercriminals can choose from a wide range of activities to use the information gathered from the data breach to perform acts of extortion. In previous cases of data breach, stolen data has been used to access bank accounts, gather further information about specific persons, used as leverage for spear phishing emails or BEC schemes, blackmail or extortion, and much more.” In a statement given in late March, Comelec downplayed the effect of the hack. “I want to emphasise that the database in our website is accessible to the public. There is no sensitive information there. We will be using a different website for the election, especially for results reporting and that one we are protecting very well,” a spokesman said. But Trend Micro says its investigations “showed a huge number of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII)–including passport information and fingerprint data–were included in the data dump.” ',?
'Hacking Man hacked random-number generator to rig lotteries, investigators say New evidence shows lottery machines were rigged to produce predictable jackpot numbers on specific days of the year netting millions in winnings ‘Computer whiz’ rigged lottery number generator to produce predictable numbers a couple of times a year. Photograph: Brian Powers/AP Friday 8 April 2016 05.49 EDT Last modified on Friday 8 April 2016 07.25 EDT Share on WhatsApp A lottery security director who was convicted of fixing a $16.5m lottery jackpot also allegedly rigged several other lottery random-number generators to be able to predict the winning numbers, according to Iowa investigators. For several years, Eddie Tipton, the former security director of the US Multi-State Lottery Association, installed software code that allowed him to predict winning numbers on specific days of the year, investigators allege. The random-number generators had been erased, but new forensic evidence has revealed how the hack was apparently done. Tipton was convicted last year of rigging the $16.5m jackpot in Iowa, and is now awaiting trial on charges linking him to prizes in Colorado, Wisconsin , Oklahoma and Kansas. Tipton was charged after authorities released surveillance footage of a person buying the winning ticket for a $16.5 million Hot Lotto jackpot and hot dogs at a Des Moines gas station in 2010. Colleagues identified the buyer as Tipton, a so-called computer whiz who had unparalleled access to lottery software. Now forensic evidence, described as a “breakthrough” by investigators, have led to charges being filed against Tipton’s younger brother, Tommy Tipton, a former justice of the peace and reserve police officer in Texas for his role in securing the Colorado and Oklahoma jackpots, which allegedly netted him $1.2m in cash. He surrendered to authorities and was released on bail. Documents filed on Wednesday show Wisconsin authorities recovered the random-number generator used for a $2m Megabucks jackpot claimed in 2008 by Eddie Tipton’s friend, Robert Rhodes. He is fighting extradition from Texas to Iowa, where he faces charges. Two ‘lucky’ days a year The number generator had apparently been hacked to produce predictable numbers on three days of the year, after the machine had gone through a security audit. All six prizes linked to Tipton were drawn between 2005 and 2011 on either 23 November or 29 December. Investigators were able to recreate the draws and produce “the very same ‘winning numbers’ from the program that was supposed to produce random numbers,” said the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agent Don Smith. Tommy Tipton first came under scrutiny in 2006 when he was discovered with $500,000 in cash in consecutively marked bills. He claimed to have won a share of a $4.5m Colorado Lotto jackpot and that he had recruited a friend to collect the winnings to avoid his wife finding out during divorce considerations. Randy Schaffer, representing Tommy Tipton, said his client “took the high road” by surrendering rather than fighting extradition. Schaffer said: “This is a guy who, until a few months ago, was a judge. He’s going to hopefully … be professional and responsible in his dealings.” ',?
'iPhone 5C San Bernardino iPhone hack won’t work on newer models, says FBI Director James Comey says US government in discussions over whether to reveal details of purchased hack that only works on 5C and older devices FBI confirms its iPhone 5C hack will not work on newer iPhones with fingerprint scanners, including the 5S, 6 and 6S. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Thursday 7 April 2016 11.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 7 April 2016 11.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey has confirmed that the law enforcement agency’s hack on the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone 5C will not work on newer iPhones. Talking to students at Ohio’s Kenyon College – Comey’s alma mater - he said: “We have a tool that works on a narrow slice of iPhones. The world has moved onto [iPhone] 6s and this doesn’t work on 6s or on iPhone 5Ss.” The FBI director confirmed that the hack works on the iPhone 5C and older Apple smartphones, but not newer models with a fingerprint sensor. This is probably because older phones lack the so-called secure enclave, which protects passcodes, security keys and handles the security of the phone’s encryption system. Comey confirmed that the FBI bought a tool from a third party, negating the need to continue its legal action against Apple. But the FBI has yet to disclose publicly how the hack that unlocked the iPhone 5C works, despite informing senators about it . Comey said: “We’re having discussions within government about it … if we tell Apple they’re going to fix it and we’re back to where we started.” Recording of Comey’s Kenyon College address. The FBI’s hand might be forced if the hack is required in a criminal case, as the information will have to be divulged under the rules of discovery. The hack is also “perishable”, according to Comey, because at any moment Apple could update iOS for the iPhone 5C and render the hack inoperable. The FBI director also confirmed that the federal agency could help local and state law enforcement by simply unlocking the older iPhones for them, but that evidence gained this way could not be used in court. Comey wouldn’t comment on who the company or persons the hack was purchased from. He would only say that “their motivations align with ours” and that the FBI and the hack provider were “very good at keeping secrets”. ',?
'iPhone 6S iPhone 6S security hole lets attackers access contacts and photos without passcode Lockscreen flaw allows attackers to quickly access personal information on a locked iPhone 6S or 6S Plus using Siri, Twitter and 3D Touch iPhone 6S flaw allows attackers to access photos and contacts without knowing the passcode using Twitter search. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA Tuesday 5 April 2016 06.02 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 6 April 2016 07.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp A security flaw with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will let anyone bypass the phone lock and access personal information without having to know the passcode. The bug, discovered by Jose Rodriguez , who found a similar security hole last year, requires Siri but unlike many other iPhone hacks is relatively easy to execute. All an attacker needs to do is fire up Siri from the lockscreen and prompt it to search Twitter for any email address. Once one is found, 3D Touching the email address will bring up a context menu from which you can create a new contact or add to an existing contact. That gives the attacker complete access to your contacts. If the Contacts app has ever been given permission to access the iPhone’s photo library, the attacker can also browse your photos by attempting to add a photo to that new or existing contact. All that is possible without unlocking the device. Pinterest Rodriguez demonstrating the lockscreen bypass , which affects iPhone 6S and 6S Plus devices running iOS 9, including the recently released version, iOS 9.3.1. Users can protect themselves from having their photos accessed with the lockscreen bypass by simply denying Siri and the Contacts app access to their photos within the iPhone’s Privacy settings. But to prevent access to contacts through the flaw requires disabling Siri while the iPhone is locked within the Touch ID and Passcode settings. The bypass bug only affects those devices with 3D Touch screens - the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus - but comes just after FBI’s recent battles with Apple to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone 5C. The federal agency has yet to divulge how it unlocked the smartphone or whether it or the third-party that is thought to have assisted it used a security flaw similar to this one to bypass the passcode. In an advisory to US local and state law enforcement, the FBI pledged to help them unlock iPhones in criminal cases where possible. Update: Apple has fixed the issue with Siri, forcing it to ask for a passcode if searching Twitter from the lockscreen. ',?
'Rahul Tyagi, a whitehat computer hacker from the small town of Gurdaspur in north India, who says many of his friends earn a decent living simply by hunting for bugs on websites such as Facebook and Twitter. Photograph: Rahul Tyagi “They earn around 1-1.5 lakh rupees (£1000-1500) a month without leaving their bedrooms.” Whilst India’s burgeoning population of 1.25bn means that getting a job can be tough, bounty-hunting schemes provide an easy way for young Internet enthusiasts to make a living. “People are just sitting at home with nothing to do,” Tyagi says, offering an explanation for the country’s large proportion of whitehat hackers. “They can’t get a job, so they learn this.” Tyagi’s own motivations for hacking though, are slightly different. “It’s about getting an appreciation from the giants of the world,” he says. “Hacking requires a curious and creative mind. And you have to keep learning every day, because the technology is changing so quickly.” Like many other big names on the Indian hacking scene, Tyagi comes from a humble background. “I was the first in my town to get a computer. I started on Windows 98.” His knowledge of computers earned him a reputation as the local techie when he was a teenager. “People used to invite me to their homes to install Windows XP. They’d give me food and sweets in exchange,” he says. “For them it was a big thing – that I knew so much about computers.” His first experiments with computer security were when he was just a child, trying to get a game for PlayStation 1 to work on his computer. “I was the only kid in the whole of Punjab who could do that at the time,” he says. “My first hacks were experimental. Curiosity kept me going.” Indian entrepreneurs and immigrants have been pioneers in the tech sector in the last few decades. But nobody saw India’s tech boom coming. The country has a low computer literacy rate of less than 7% and until recently , the country’s telecommunications infrastructure was weak and underdeveloped. Academics have cited the government’s non-interventionist approach as one explanation for India’s success in the IT sector. Former IT minister Pramod Mahajan once said that “IT and beauty contests are the two areas the government has stayed out of.” Prakash argues that India’s cyber security sector could grow even faster with some help from the government. “The Indian government hasn’t understood how big our potential is when it comes to hacking. The most talented hackers are Indian, the highest number of bugs are reported from here. We need to cultivate that talent.” Trishneet Arora a 22-year old hacker from the city of Ludhiana in northern India started as an ethical hacker, and has created a successful cyber security business with his skills.

'Mexico Hacker claims he helped Enrique Peña Nieto win Mexican presidential election Andrés Sepúlveda said he and other hackers installed malware to monitor opponents during 2012 campaign as part of ‘black propaganda’ operation An imprisoned Colombian hacker claimed he had manipulated elections in eight Latin American countries and Mexico, where Enrique Peña Nieto was elected in 2012. Photograph: Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images Jonathan Watts , Latin America correspondent, and David Agren Friday 1 April 2016 00.53 EDT Share on WhatsApp A digital dark arts campaign by mercenary hackers helped Enrique Peña Nieto win Mexico’s 2012 presidential election, according to an imprisoned Colombian hacker who says he was involved. Andrés Sepúlveda, an online campaign strategist, claimed he had also helped to manipulate elections in nine countries across Latin America by stealing data, installing malware and creating fake waves of enthusiasm and derision on social media. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek , the Colombian – who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence – boasted of his ability to hack into campaign networks and manipulate opinion. “My job was to do actions of dirty war and psychological operations, black propaganda, rumours – the whole dark side of politics that nobody knows exists but everyone can see,” the 31-year-old told Bloomberg. However, Sepúlveda’s claims are fiercely contested by some of those he accuses. Juan José Rendón, the Miami-based political consultant who allegedly hired the hacker, told the Guardian he had only met him once and used his service only indirectly via subcontractors for website design in 2005. “He is delusional,” Rendón said in a phone call. “All the things he describes are exactly like the TV show Mr Robot.” Denying all accusations of wrongdoing, Rendón challenged Sepúlveda and Bloomberg to provide evidence of the claims in the form of emails or CCTV footage. He also cast doubt on the suggestion that the Internet is decisive in shaping public opinion. “Can you really change the will of the people through social networks? Maybe in Ukraine or Syria where there is no alternatives. But here (in the Americas) where there is TV, a free press and door to door campaigns, it is not so influential,” he said. Although he was well paid for his work, Sepúlveda said his primary motive was political. He supported right and centre-right candidates against what he called “dictatorships and socialists governments”. In Mexico , however, he reportedly had a $600,000 budget to undermine the campaigns of Peña Nieto’s two main opponents on either side of the political spectrum: the ruling National Action party’s Josefina Vázquez Mota and the Democratic Revolution party’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador. His team are said to have installed malware at the headquarters of the two candidates, which let them monitor phones and computers. According to the report, Sepúlveda saw speech drafts, meetings plans and campaign schedules as they were typed into the keyboard. Using this information, he used a “virtual army” of fake Twitter accounts to direct public debate towards subjects that would strengthen Peña Nieto – for example by acclaiming his plan to crack down on drug violence – or embarrass rivals. Sepúlveda said he brought high-quality fake accounts that had been maintained for more than a year to make them look genuine, as well as generating 30,000 low-end Twitter bots that bumped up numbers of “likes” and “follows”, thereby creating memes and shaping discussion. “When I realized that people believe what the internet says more than reality, I discovered that I had the power to make people believe almost anything,” he told Bloomberg. The black propaganda could also be more focussed. To alienate the conservative Catholic supporters of a regional candidate in Tabasco, Sepúlveda claims he set up fake Facebook accounts of gay men to provide unwelcome support. In the swing state of Jalisco, he deliberately upset voters with automated 3am campaign calls purportedly coming from leftwing gubernatorial candidate Enrique Alfaro Ramírez – who subsequently lost by a narrow margin. Related: Mexico Catholic church accused of bending marriage rules for president To varying degrees, he said he applied similar tactics in other elections over an eight-year period in in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia , Costa Rica and Guatemala. Sepúlveda is now in jail for hacking crimes related to Colombia’s 2014 presidential election, when he tried to help rightwing opposition candidate Óscar Iván Zuluaga who opposed peace talks with the leftwing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). After several attempts on his life, he reportedly choose to go public with his allegations so he can win support for a reduced sentence. Sepúlveda said he destroyed most of the evidence and that many of the candidates he helped may be unaware of his role, which was organised via middlemen. Chief among them is Rendón, dubbed the “ Karl Rove of Latin America ”. The article cites email between the two men. But Rendón said the emails had not come from any of his accounts. Peña Nieto’s office issued a statement on Thursday night, saying: “We reject any relationship between the 2012 presidential campaign team and Andrés Sepúlveda or that there was a contract with the consultant J.J. Rendón.” The statement also disavowed the use of the “information and methods outlined by the said article”, and that, “the actions of the campaign abided by the rules and restrictions established in the applicable electoral legislation”. Jorge Ramírez Marín, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PR) and vice-coordinator of the 2012 campaign, called the story: “Absolutely false. It has no basis in reality. It’s frankly fantasy.” He also pointed out the PRI was the federal opposition in 2012, though it dominated a majority of the increasingly influential and opaque Mexican state governments. López Obrador, who also finished second in a 2006 election he considers to have been rigged, said via Facebook the allegations were “nothing new, although it’s repugnant and evil”. Rendón told Bloomberg he had worked on behalf of PRI candidates for 16 years. ',?
'Share on WhatsApp Attitudes towards online abuse have undergone a sea change over the last decade. In the past, cyber-harassment – often a perfect storm of threats, impersonations, defamation, and privacy invasions directed at an individual – was routinely dismissed as “no big deal”. So it was for one Yale law student. Starting in 2007 , on an online discussion board, a cyber-mob falsely accused her of having herpes and sleeping with her dean. Anonymous posters described how they would rape her; they chronicled her daily whereabouts and prior jobs. Yet law enforcement told the student to ignore the attacks because “boys will be boys”. Officers advised her to “clean up” her cyber-reputation, as if she could control what appeared about her. Trivialising online abuse and blaming victims was the norm. There are laws available in the UK to bring to bear against online abuse Today, the public has a deeper appreciation of victims’ suffering. As advocacy groups like the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative have shown, and as society has come to recognise, the costs of cyber-harassment are steep. Because searches of victims’ names prominently display the abuse, victims have lost their jobs. They have had difficulty finding employment. Employers do not interview victims because hiring people with damaged online reputations is risky. Victims struggle with anxiety and depression. They withdraw from online engagement to avoid further abuse. Women, especially younger women, are more often targeted than men, but in either case, the abuse often has a sexually demeaning and sexually threatening cast. Legal developments reflect a growing understanding of cyber-harassment’s harms. In the US, 27 states have criminalised revenge porn – also known as non-consensual pornography. California’s attorney general Kamala Harris created a first-of-its-kind online resource to train law enforcement about cyber-harassment. Her office successfully prosecuted revenge porn operators for soliciting the posting of nude photos and charging for their removal. Inspired by Harris, the Federal Trade Commission entered into a consent decree with a revenge porn operator for inducing the disclosure of confidential information for financial gain. In the UK, cyber-harassers have been held responsible for their destruction. There are now laws to bring to bear against online abuse. Prosecutions under the Malicious Communications Act have resulted in convictions, as in the case involving death threats tweeted at Caroline Criado-Perez . In April 2015, the UK criminalised revenge pornography . What the UK still needs is better training of law enforcement and perhaps some clarification of the laws already on the books rather than a new set of laws, as the Conservative MP Maria Miller suggested this week . Related: Two jailed for Twitter abuse of feminist campaigner Even with better training the law is a blunt tool. Its effectiveness depends upon the discretion of the officials invoking it. We have seen law enforcement pursue frivolous cases , which undermine society’s confidence in harassment and threat laws. We have seen prosecutors pursue individuals who, by all societal accounts, are either trying to help others or are victims themselves . Prosecutorial overreaching and poor judgment are risks, no matter the crime at hand. But efforts to deter and prosecute crimes should not be abandoned because some prosecutors may abuse their power. Then, too, law may not be able to reach some online assaults. For instance, criminal law may not cover the individual acts of a cyber-mob, even though the abuse as a whole is destructive. Each member of a mob may have contributed a little and thus no one person has transgressed harassment laws, which require repeated “course of conduct”. There is also the practical reality of dealing with a cyber-mob. As in the case of games designer Zoe Quinn , who was targeted in “ Gamergate ”, victims have urged prosecutors to drop cases because the attacks got worse – not better – after charges were filed. Civil claims can only be brought if victims have the resources to hire counsel or find lawyers to take on cases pro bono. Since law cannot do it all, and should not do it all given our commitments to free expression, who else can combat cyber-harassment? Civil society should step in. Schools, community leaders, and family members should help inculcate norms of respect. Being told to avoid playground fights at school is par for the course – so too should be discussions about the responsibilities of digital citizenship. Young people must be taught about our shared responsibility for online safety. Private companies have a role to play as well. Indeed, market forces may be pushing them in that direction. Advertisers have threatened to pull their business unless platforms ban bigoted online abuse. Whether it is thanks to commercial interests or social responsibility, some online platforms have taken a stand against cyber-harassment. Social media providers, including Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter, now ban threats, cyber-harassment, and non-consensual pornography. Related: Insults and rape threats. Writers shouldn’t have to deal with this | Jessica Valenti Companies should be clear about their policies. They need to explain what they mean by “cyber-harassment”, “non-consensual pornography”, “threats” and “bullying”. Users will then have a better understanding of precisely what is and what is not prohibited. Platforms should explain whether content will be taken down or what the next step would be. To ensure the fairness of the complaint process, companies should notify users of their decisions and give them a chance to appeal. Of course, private companies do not owe their users any formal obligation of due process. But they should have an appeals procedure, because when people perceive a process to be fair they are more inclined to accept its results. Clear policies, a means of review, and transparent enforcement decisions will help to protect users from destructive abuse and set clear norms for sites. What about startups that lack resources to address complaints comprehensively? Users could be recruited to help enforce community norms. The multiplayer online game League of Legends has enlisted users to help address players’ abusive behaviour , notably harassment and bigoted epithets, with much success. In short, there is no magic bullet to combat cyber-harassment. But this is an opportune moment to educate the public about the destruction wrought by cyber-harassment and the various ways of addressing it. Social attitudes trivialising it can be reversed before they become entrenched. If we act now, future generations might view cyber-harassment as a disgraceful remnant of the internet’s early history.

This is the lowest I’ve sunk on behalf of this feature. Rifling through bins. Here is an image of the contents I uncovered: Pinterest Here is my review of those contents: The wrapper: I don’t know what this wrapper is for because finding out would mean touching it. It looks crisp, clear and presumably wrapped whatever it was wrapping ably. The tissue: I do know what these tissues are for because I put them in there roughly half an hour before this photograph was taken. The tissues were soft – Sainsbury’s Super Soft Aloe Vera, if memory serves – and smelled very fine indeed. A second wrapper (to left of image): Bananas. This definitely contained bananas. Technically, bananas already come bunched and encased within natural wrappers, so this artificial wrapper seems slightly unnecessary. I would like to add a final note: the bin I reviewed had been emptied fairly recently. Yet more proof that the Guardian’s superlative facilities department is second to none, but not exactly conducive to a thrilling review. The bin’s contents: 4/10 The Guardian’s facilities department: 10/10 LH Pinterest The final clause of this suggestion is music to any time-pressed anything-reviewer’s ears, and I’m no exception. Conducting a comprehensive survey of “computer games based on pop stars” would be an actual journalistic enterprise that could potentially involve time and/or effort, so thank God I only had to look at about six pictures before extrapolating some intrinsically worthless judgment. (There was a YouTube video of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood game, but the amount of information contained therein was clearly not just superfluous, but actively contrary to Whitlock & Pope’s requirements. So that’s 22 minutes of my life I still have today.) You might think the more information you have, the easier it is to review anything: not so. In fact, information often complicates the reductive summaries every reviewer longs to write. So what observations can I make about computer games based on pop stars using the limited materials I have at my disposal? Well, the pixels are relatively large. Sometimes they are brightly coloured, sometimes they aren’t. Granted, attributing any sort of value to these observations is not that easy, but that’s why we employ a numerical system! 4/10 Footie selecta Idris Elba as Heimdall in Thor.

'Share on WhatsApp Even if you are yet to receive the government’s pro-EU leaflet, you’ve probably heard about it . But have you noticed how well it fits with the popular board game Cards Against Humanity? The EU and a game known for its political incorrectness don’t seem like the most likely bedfellows – yet the minute a leaflet arrived at software engineer Jenny Owen’s home, the partnership seemed perfect. For the uninitiated, this is how the game works: it’s essentially a fill-in-the-blanks game where players pick the funniest – and usually, in practice, the rudest – answer to win a round. ',?
'Share on WhatsApp I am the lead developer on a multiplayer survival game named Rust . Last week, we made a change to the game that upset a lot of people: we made half of our players, picked at random, play as women. We also made some of them black. The response has been extreme. Rust is not a game about identity . The objective in Rust is to survive. This is made difficult by things such as starvation, dehydration, radiation, exposure and bear attacks. The biggest threat in the game comes from other players who are trying to survive in the same conditions. You will survive better if you’re a part of a group, but this takes a lot of mutual trust. If you kill someone you’ll be able to loot their corpse and take all their food, medicine and weapons. This makes the game very interesting socially, since players struggle with trust and slowly build up relationships with one another. Related: The identity paradox: why game characters are not us, but should be The game is in “early access”, which means it’s in active development and we update it every week. Despite this, it has sold over 3.5m copies since it was first released in 2013, and around half a million people play every week. Whenever a project has this kind of popularity, people become very passionate. But the range and strength of opinions have never been this intense. Originally every player appeared in game as a white bald guy. We were still in the early stages of development and had other things to focus on. Recently, though, we decided to change this. We decided that we didn’t want players to pick their own appearance. We felt that player customisation had got a bit out of control in other games. And we didn’t want to spend six months making a player customisation tool – we wanted to concentrate on the game. We also wanted the appearance of the players to be consistent over time. A survivor shouldn’t be able to attack another then come back later with a different gender or race and befriend the same player. They should be recognisable consistently and long-term – so anyone likely to commit a crime would be more likely to wear a balaclava or a face mask. So this is what we did. Gender and race are randomly selected and linked to a player’s account, permanently unchangeable. Inevitably, there are people who like it and people who don’t. Some players have praised what we’re doing. Like us, they think that who you are in the game, your race and gender, makes no difference to the actual gameplay – and are happy to have the diversity. Others aren’t so positive. They feel that playing a gender or race that doesn’t match their own is detrimental to their enjoyment. For race, this seems to be a regional thing. For example, most complaints about being black in the game have generally been from Russian players. With gender it seems to be more of a geography-free complaint. Here’s one of the many messages we’ve received from disgruntled male players: “Why won’t you give the player base an option to choose their gender? I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play. Not have some political movement shoved down my throat because you make the connection we can’t choose our gender in reality so let’s make it like that in game too.” Others have accused us of forcing them to accept our “feminist ideals”. Some have told us that they are quitting the game entirely. One called the move the dumbest thing we’ve ever done. Our female players seem more pragmatic. They point out that they’ve already being play Rust as men for the past two years. Some have got in touch to thank us. Mostly they see it as no big deal. Related: Pro-gaming tournament attempts to limit gay and transgender players We’ve also received complaints from transgender players . One called the new system horrifying, unpleasant and uncomfortable. Another argued that assigning a fixed sex was reminiscent of real-world transphobia. It’s maybe understandable why some male gamers wouldn’t want to play as women. They’re just not used to being forced to. You could probably count on your fingers the number of major, big-budget games where you have no choice but to play as a woman, never mind having no choice but to play as a black woman. Female gamers are obviously more forgiving – they’ve been playing games as men for most of their lives. I understand the arguments from transgender players – well, as much as a straight man can. But it feels to me like the same response stands. We’re assigning gender randomly in game – not in real life. Ultimately the decision comes down to gameplay. We don’t believe that letting you choose your race and gender would improve the game. On the other hand, randomising everyone’s gender and race meets all our requirements. We get an even spread of races and genders that make players more identifiable – while at the same time making the social aspects of the game much more interesting. ',?
'Pinterest Zoe Quinn, founder of Crash Override. Photograph: Samuel Kirby “One of the biggest myths is that your first response to being abused should be to go to the police and seek justice,” she wrote. “Leaving aside the fact that the police flat-out murder unarmed citizens for their race all the time, and that sex workers are likely to be incarcerated when reporting crime done to them … getting a restraining order against [him] was the least effective thing I could do in terms of getting him out of my life for good, and for protecting myself.” Quinn founded the Crash Override network , a grassroots “crisis helpline, advocacy group and resource centre” for people experiencing abuse online. Thanks to private donors and financial support from Anita Sarkeesian’s Feminist Frequency, it is free for people seeking help. Crash Override offers confidential support and advice on self-protection: how to behave if you are targeted, what to do if your home address is published, how to activate security tools on your accounts. It also offers advice on how to talk to your employer, as it’s common for abusers to bombard a target’s workplace with false accusations, hoax phone calls and other tactics designed to discredit them. Quinn says this resource is visited by over 6,000 people per month. Ferrier is also fighting back with TrollBusters , a “rescue service for women journalists, bloggers and publishers”. Ferrier prototyped the site with four other women using a $3,000 grant for women in news entrepreneurship, and later received $35,000 from the Knight Foundation , which supports quality journalism and media innovation. Twitter, Facebook and other social media tools do offer users the option to block, report or mute offenders, and sometimes people are banned or suspended. But this approach focuses on the abuser, with the target often expected to do their own labor of managing their online experience even as they face threats. Ferrier says that when targets see their online life drowned out by lies and smear messages, professional testimonials and endorsements can help support them. At the point of attack, TrollBusters sends supportive images and affirmations , like “I always take positive action in the face of fear”, into a targeted person’s social media feed. It offers what Ferrier calls a “hedge of protection”. TrollBusters teams can also document and monitor an attack so that the target doesn’t have to sit online watching the abuse unfold. “Stories of or by people of colour tend to be targeted the most,” Ferrier says. “It never matters what the topic is – we got the worst comments on a story about an African American family whose house had just burned down. “We’re talking about shutting down voices in media. Some journalists are not trained on these issues at all, and we don’t talk about the dangers of this job, both online and off,” she says. Media outlets currently don’t prepare reporters for the possibility that they might be targeted online, she says, and nor do they sufficiently account for the need to protect sources, particularly those on topics of race and gender. Harassment is complex; nobody wakes up in the morning saying ‘I’m going to be an asshole today’ Randi Lee Harper Holly Brockwell is a UK-based journalist who founded the tech site Gadgette . She recently reported on an app called Stolen , which was built around the premise of “owning” Twitter users like trading cards, without asking them whether they wanted to opt-in. Brockwell received an unsolicited notice that she was “owned” by a stranger, and wrote a story pointing out that the app could encourage online abuse. The contrite developer volunteered to take Stolen down and revisit it, but even that civil exchange brought Brockwell a flood of hate; someone tweeted her an image of her own face with semen on it. Brockwell is used to attacks, and has a policy of publicly sharing the abusive messages and images she gets. “I’m constantly told I’m making life worse for myself by calling out trolls and harassers,” she says. “I’m told I’m giving them what they want, nourishing their rotten souls with attention, giving their unhappy lives some meaning. Well, maybe I am. But that’s my decision. “Watching how someone copes with a horrendous situation isn’t your opportunity to jump in and tell them how to do it better. I’ve tried every method for dealing with harassers: blocking, ignoring, responding, reporting, mocking, crying, everything. And do you know what worked? Nothing. So the only option left is the one that makes me feel better, that gives me back some control.” Brockwell says that even with experience of harassment, it’s a challenge for any outlet, especially one led by women, to protect writers. “We had to remove our comment section very early on in the site’s existence after a series of horrific, threatening messages,” she says. But getting rid of comments doesn’t keep staff safe because “more motivated” harassers end up redoubling their efforts on things like “novel-length emails”. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook or Reddit often talk a strong game about their concern for user safety, and occasionally they invite in those who have been working closely on abuse issues, as with Twitter’s recently announced Trust and Safety Council . On Monday, the Guardian reported an initiative by Google, Facebook and Twitter to foster a global grassroots counter-speech movement . The tech firms are reaching out to women’s groups, NGOs and communities in Africa, America, India, Europe and the Middle East as the scale of online abuse continues to increase. But critics say the companies should be doing more to clean up abuse on their own sites. ',?
'Virtual reality How one developer is remaking VR rules with 1980s game Battlezone UK-based Rebellion is reviving the arcade hit as its first virtual reality game. But the company is playing by new rules One of the enemy tanks in Battlezone. Photograph: Rebellion Developments Ltd Wednesday 13 April 2016 05.47 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 13 April 2016 05.57 EDT Share on WhatsApp In some ways, 1980s arcade hit Battlezone can lay claim to being the first “virtual reality” game to hit the market. Its rudimentary vector-based graphics presented a 3D view of head-to-head tank combat, viewed by the player through a periscope-style screen. A far cry from what’s offered by the Oculus Rifts of today’s world. But squeezing your face against the viewfinder of one of the remaining cabinets, which were already old when I was young, does summon some of the same feelings. You find yourself falling into the world, aware of what you can and can’t see through the limited field of view – and, unfortunately, a bit discomfited by the sweaty physical port through which you’re staring. So it makes sense for a revived version of the game to be Oxford-based developer Rebellion’s first foray into the latest wave of VR. The company, which acquired the Battlezone brand from its creator Atari back in 2013, hopes to launch its spin on the classic alongside Sony’s Playstation VR in the autumn, with versions for the Oculus Rift and Vive following soon after. As a result, Rebellion becomes one of the growing number of developers tasked with writing the very ground rules of virtual reality. Pinterest A swarm of drones flies through Battlezone’s arena. Photograph: Rebellion Developments Ltd There’s a lot that can go wrong. The latest generation of VR devices, led by the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Playstation VR, provide a fairly intense experience. The screens, strapped to your face, occupy your entire field of view, while headphones block out the sound of the outside world. “The intensity can be a problem,” says Jason Kingsley, Rebellion’s chief executive and creative director. “We have a responsibility to make sure that people aren’t impacted, in a negative way, by this new technology.” To some extent, that’s a question of modifying what you put in the game. For instance, jump scares are beloved of horror gamers,but put that same effect in virtual reality, and even the hardiest fan may well end up tearing the headset off their face screaming. For Kingsley himself, who suffers from vertigo, a similar effect was triggered by a simulation of a rollercoaster. “Even though I knew it wasn’t real, and told myself I could overcome, I was dripping wet from sweat within seconds,” he said. But even if the content is adapted to make up for the intensity of the experience, there are other issues to deal with. Like the fact that bad VR will give you splitting headaches then make you throw up, for one. To avoid that, the game needs a high framerate and accurate head tracking, but it also needs to give up on artistic techniques which are common in games, TV and cinema. For instance, you can’t lock the field of view, and you can’t take control of the camera, explains Kingsley. It’s easy to understand why: doing so would feel as though some invisible hand had reached down and grabbed your head, twisting it to where it needs to be. And yet, without any inner-ear response, it also risks inspiring immediate nausea. But that poses a problem for any sort of storytelling if the player needs to be looking in a specific direction at a specific time. In Battlezone, this is achieved with a wide field of view, ensuring that most of what’s in front of you can be seen anyway, as well as some smart signposting in the tutorial mode. Being taught to fire your main guns doubles up as guidance to look up, and ends with you moving, not forward, but up into the roof – guidance to the player to remember their entire sphere of vision as they play. The game is also helped by being set in a futuristic tank, because the player doesn’t have to control a standing avatar. Sitting in the chair in real life is matched by sitting in the cockpit in-game, which avoids disconcerting mismatches between body positions. It also avoids a problem faced by makers of more physical VR games, where the player is standing up and walking around: namely, trip hazards. ',?
'Grand Theft Auto Rockstar dismisses $150m Grand Theft Auto lawsuit as ’bizarre’ Company claims producer Leslie Benzies exhibited ‘conduct and performance’ issues before his departure from GTA development studio, Rockstar North Grand Theft Auto V … Rockstar has rebutted allegations by Leslie Benzies, producer of the GTA series. Photograph: Rockstar Wednesday 13 April 2016 04.29 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 13 April 2016 07.26 EDT Share on WhatsApp Rockstar Games, the publisher behind the multimillion-selling Grand Theft Auto series has issued a response to the $150m (£105m) lawsuit launched against it by former employee, Leslie Benzies. In the brief statement, the company dismisses the allegations made in the 70-page suit, launched by Benzies through US law firm, Locke Lord. Benzies claims to have been encouraged to take a sabbatical in 2014, only to discover that Sam and Dan Houser, the founders of Rockstar, were conspiring to have him removed from the company. He claims that the duo sought to renege on a 2009 royalties deal which would ensure Benzies retained financial parity with the brothers. Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar has since launched a counteraction against Benzies. Through a terse statement Rockstar said: “Leslie Benzies was a valued employee of our company for many years. Sadly, the events that culminated in his resignation ultimately stem from his significant performance and conduct issues. Despite our repeated efforts to address and resolve these issues amicably both before and after his departure, Leslie has chosen to take this route in an attempt to set aside contract terms to which he previously agreed on multiple occasions. His claims are entirely without merit and in many instances downright bizarre, and we are very confident this matter will be resolved in our favour. “A core ethos since Rockstar’s inception has been the concept of ‘the team’. It is deeply disappointing and simply wrong for Leslie to attempt to take personal credit for what has always been the tremendous efforts of the entire Rockstar team, who remain hard at work delivering the most immersive and engaging entertainment experiences we can for our fans. “We do not intend to comment further on this matter.” Benzies was lead producer and a creative director of the Grand Theft Auto series since 1999 when work began on Grand Theft Auto III. He was also president of Rockstar North, the Edinburgh studio responsible for much of the development on the series. He claims that his unfair dismissal led to the loss of over $150m in royalties. Take-Two Interactive has stated in its counter action that Benzies chose to leave. His lawsuit makes many allegations about Rockstar and specifically Sam Houser, who he labels “incapable of completing large scale and complex games” without Benzies’ supervision. The suit alleges that Sam Houser became suspicious that Benzies “wanted to take over the company”, when the producer arranged for his name to appear last in the game credits to GTA Online, a multiplayer component of Grand Theft Auto V . Previously Houser’s name was always the last to appear in Rockstar production credits. A press release issued by Locke Lorde stated: “Mr. Benzies’ removal after years of receiving compensation identical to the Housers was the product of what turned out to be a lengthy deception by Sam Houser. The complaint describes Sam Houser’s mounting resentments after many years of high praise.” ',?
'Games Grand Theft Auto producer sues publisher for $150m in unpaid royalties Lawsuit claims Les Benzies was ‘enticed’ into taking a sabbatical in September 2014, a year after the release of the popular video game Grand Theft Auto V: producer Les Benzies claims he was forced out. Photograph: Rockstar Tuesday 12 April 2016 16.31 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 18.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp The producer behind the multimillion-selling Grand Theft Auto video games is suing the publisher of the series, Take-Two Interactive, for $150m. Les Benzies, previously president of Rockstar North, the studio that developed the hit franchise from Grand Theft Auto III onwards, claims that he was “enticed” into taking a sabbatical in September 2014, a year after the release of Grand Theft Auto V. He then returned to the office six months later to find that his access to the building had been revoked. A press release issued by law firm Locke Lord states: “While on sabbatical, Mr Benzies discovered numerous deceptions on the part of Take-Two, Rockstar, Rockstar North Ltd, Sam Houser and Dan Houser, who sought to force him out of the company and terminate his portion of royalty payments based upon arbitrary actions by the company’s royalty Allocation Committee, a committee that may or may not have actually ever met. “As the lawsuit describes, based upon agreements in place, as one of three named Rockstar Principals, Mr Benzies is owed in excess of $150m in unpaid royalties.” The dispute centres on a 2009 royalty plan signed by Benzies and the founders of Rockstar, Sam and Dan Houser, which he claims ensured he would have parity with the brothers. Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has now filed a counter suit , claiming Benzies left the company of his own volition, and consequently is not entitled, “to any post-termination royalties”. Asked to comment on Take-Two’s counter, Christopher Bakes of Locke Lord, the chief litigator on the Benzies case, told the Guardian, “The short answer is that we believe the detailed and extensive factual allegations contained in Mr. Benzies’ Complaint amply address those contained in the somewhat sparse Take-Two Complaint. “Needless to say, Mr. Benzies believes the issues between the parties are far broader than as presented by Take-Two and Mr. Benzies’ Complaint reflects that.” Benzies is considered one of the key members of the Grand Theft Auto creative team, having been a producer on the series since the hugely successful third title, released in 2001, which saw development move from DMA design in Dundee to Rockstar North, based in Edinburgh. The Locke Lord lawsuit claims that Sam and Dan Houser, were attempting to force Benzies out of the company and that there was “mounting resentment” between Sam Houser and Benzies. The lawsuit alleges that Sam Houser was angry when Benzies put his own name at the end of the production credits for GTA Online, a multiplayer mode for Grand Theft Auto V; traditionally Sam Houser’s name is the last to be displayed in the credits for Rockstar titles. The suit alleges that the Houser said Benzies “wanted to take over the company”. According to Benzies’s suit, Rockstar threatened to make “scurrilous allegations” against him if he continued to assert his rights. “This was a shocking development given that Sam Houser himself had orchestrated and encouraged a company culture involving strip clubs, personal photography of employees in sexually compromising positions, and other conduct grossly in violation of standard workplace norms.” The Guardian has approached Rockstar and Take-Two for comment.

'Pinterest People play on machines at the pinball hall of fame in Las Vegas. Photograph: pinballhall.org Passionate and curmudgeonly, this self-proclaimed Director of Things and Stuff wonders if his replacement will ever be found. “You’ve got to ask yourself ‘Is this a Beach Boys operation or a Jan and Dean operation? If a Beach Boy dies, you can just hand somebody a surfboard and a pair of shorts and you go on. But if a Jan or a Dean dies, there goes the act.” Arnold is searching, of course, for a modern version of his younger self – a kid who fell in love with the pinball machine as a symbol of cultural rebellion. The game was born in Chicago in the 1930s, where wood from Wisconsin was plentiful for the construction of table-top machines into which a player inserted a penny to launch a ball that bounced off pins before falling into pockets for scoring. The game soon became popular in the city’s vast tavern industry and – like most things in Chicago in those days – was taken over by organized crime and turned into a gambling device. By the 1970s, the games were considered decadent in Arnold’s home town of Duluth, Minnesota, which outlawed all forms of gambling. Still, every convenience store and pizza parlor had them. “The fact that you could win a free game was considered gambling in my repressive Calvinist home town,” he said. “It was something for nothing, the forbidden fruit, and that fascinated me.” In 1972, Arnold bought his first game – a 1966 Gottlieb Mayfair machine – and charged 10 cents apiece for friends to play in his garage. He soon bought others and put them in laundromats and grocery stories. In 1976, Arnold and his younger brother opened Pinball Pete’s, just outside East Lansing, Michigan. Their timing was as perfect as a well-played pinball: the video-screen revolution with its blinking, beeping, crazy-colorful silk screens became a huge fad. Business quadrupled. Soon the brothers were running seven arcades in Michigan. Here, the story pauses. Suddenly, a woman is in Arnold’s face: “We put a dollar in the change machine but only 50 cents came out,” she says. He sighs and trundles off to help her. As he returns to his work, he spots a kid slamming the glass of a nearby machine. “Hey!” he yells across the room. “Don’t pound on the machine!” Soon, an eight-year-old boy is standing at his side. “Do you work here?” he asks. Arnold shoots him a “Go away kid, ya bother me” look. The boy has lost 50 cents in a machine. Arnold hands him two quarters. “Play something else,” he commands. ',?
'Apple iPhone SE review – too small for most people 4 / 5 stars Taking the guts of the iPhone 6S and squeezing them into the frame of the iPhone 5S is great, but only those who really want a 4in phone should buy one The Apple iPhone SE is one of the best smaller phones available, but its 4in screen is just a bit too small for 2016. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Wednesday 13 April 2016 02.00 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 13 April 2016 02.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp With the iPhone SE everything that is old is now new again, but is that a good thing and is a small, 4in smartphone really up to scratch in 2016? The new iPhone SE comes in at the bottom end of Apple’s iPhone range on cost, below the iPhone 6S and 2014’s iPhone 6, a spot typically filled by last year’s model. It’s now the only smartphone Apple makes with a screen smaller than 4.7in, which for some could be a big deal. For others it could be a deal breaker. iPhone 5, 5S or iPhone SE? Pinterest All-metal body, glass top and bottom and a glass-front, a mirror image of the iPhone 5 and 5S. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone SE is the spitting image of the iPhone 5S. The only differences are that the edges are the same colour and texture as the back of the device, it comes in rose gold, the Apple logo on the back is shiny, and there’s a small “SE” emblem on the back, reminiscent of the Machintosh SE from 1987. It’s still relatively slender at 7.6mm thick - its hard square edges make it feel thicker than it is - and it weighs 113g, which is quite light for a smartphone these days. Then again, it’s very small for a smartphone in 2016. The screen is the same as the 5S, 4in on the diagonal with the same quality colours, brightness and blacks. Compared to the iPhone 6S the screen is noticeably weaker, with poorer blacks and vibrancy. It’s not a bad screen by any stretch of the imagination, it’s just a good screen from two years ago, which is exactly what it is. In the hand the body feels sharp and hard, with unforgiving edges which are only acceptable because of the phone’s diminutive size. The hard edges are easier to grip than the slippery rounded sides of the iPhone 6S, and particularly the large 6S Plus, but they hurt my palms after clutching it for an hour or two. The iPhone SE’s closest rival is the excellent Sony Xperia Z5 Compact , which has a significantly larger 4.6in display, weighs 138g, is 8.9mm thick and has slightly larger dimensions. Practically no other 4in devices in this high-end category exist anymore. Using a 4in screen in 2016 is a compromise. Websites feel very cramped, apps often leave only a small amount of screen to the content they’re trying to display and buttons can end up very small making tapping them a bit of a challenge. The display is decent, but not quite as good as modern displays on today’s top-end smartphones. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Specifications Screen: 4in 1136 x 640 pixels (326 ppi) Processor: dual-core Apple A9 RAM: 2GB of RAM Storage: 16/64GB; no SD card Operating system: iOS 9.3 Camera: 12MP rear camera, 1.2MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm Weight: 113g Three generations in one device Pinterest The Touch ID sensor is slower than the one on the iPhone 6S, which makes it easier to see the lockscreen, but also forces you to wait a second or so to get to the homescreen. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian When you dig into the innards of the iPhone SE things start to get more interesting. It has a combination of iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S parts. The processor and graphics chip is an Apple A9 from the iPhone 6S, which makes it as fast as its bigger brother. It also has 2GB of RAM - double the iPhone 5S - which makes multitasking or browsing multiple tabs in Safari a lot faster with less reloading. Performance is much faster overall than the iPhone 5S and feels similar to that of the iPhone 6S, apart from the fingerprint sensor, which is pretty slow for a 2016 smartphone costing £350+. It’s the same original Touch ID sensor from the iPhone 5S/6, not the new, much faster Touch ID sensor from the 6S, which is disappointing. The iPhone SE’s battery life is better than the 6S, mirroring that of the 6S Plus. Using it as my main device, with hundreds of emails, push notifications, three hours of browsing and listening to music - without the Facebook app installed - the iPhone SE lasted a solid working day. I went to bed with 10% battery left and work up eight hours later with 5%. Compared to other iPhones, most will see better battery out of the SE, but it doesn’t come close to its closest Android competitor, the Xperia Z5 Compact , which lasted as long as three days between charges. Call quality was excellent. I also didn’t suffer from the reported Bluetooth audio issues . iOS 9 Pinterest The iPhone SE runs Apple’s latest version of iOS 9.3.1 with Night Mode, which reduces the blue light emitted by the display intended to help you sleep. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone SE comes loaded with iOS 9.3 , which currently runs on the iPhone 4S and newer, including the iPhone 5S. It includes features such as Apple’s Night Mode, which reduces the amount of blue light emitted by the display in the evening to help you sleep. It’s the exact same version running on the iPhone 6S currently and behaves as such, minus the 3D Touch gestures that the SE does not support. It’s worth noting that iOS works better on smaller devices, where your thumb can reach all areas of the screen. Activating the Control Center feels more consistent, as does swapping between apps using the task switcher on the smaller screen. Pinterest The camera is the same as the iPhone 6S and as such is very good, if not quite the best. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The rear camera is the same 12-megapixel shooter as fitted in the iPhone 6S and performs as such. It’s one of the better cameras available on a smartphone, with good detail and colour balance, but it has been bettered recently by cameras from Samsung , Sony and Google . It is a big step up from the iPhone 5S with 4K video recording and Apple’s Live Photos, which are nice to play with but end up being a gimmick that’s difficult to share with non-iPhone users. The 1.2-megapixel selfie camera, however, is the same as that fitted to the iPhone 5S and is distinctly worse than the rear camera or that fitted to the iPhone 6S, which is a shame. It will shoot decent selfies in good light, but struggles in low-light conditions. Price The iPhone SE is available in four colours and two storage options costing £359 for 16GB of space and £439 for 64GB of space. For comparison, the iPhone 6S costs £539 , the iPhone 6 costs £459 and the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact costs £300. Observations It took a full phone reset to get iCloud Music/iTunes Match to work properly, which was deeply irritating . Do not buy the 16GB version unless you can help it. 16GB of storage will rapidly be filled up with apps, videos, music and photos. The iPhone SE will fit in any cases and take any accessories designed for the iPhone 5S or 5 Apple Pay is supported, unlike the 5S Compared to larger phones the SE feels more robust Typing on the 4in screen is quite fiddly and slow - my thumbs clashed on the tiny keyboard My hands started to cramp after half a day trying to grip the small phone The hard edges were sore on my palms and are a downgrade over the iPhone 5S. Stick it in a case. The iPhone SE lacks 3D touch and the Taptic engine from the iPhone 6S, which means many of the new gestures built into iOS9 for swapping between apps etc are not available. Verdict The iPhone SE is one of the best of the very few small phones still available. It would be a significant downgrade from an iPhone 6, isn’t a quantum leap over the iPhone 5S and should only really be considered if size is the overriding factor. It might make a good first iPhone, but it feels like a step backwards - the 4in screen is very small for browsing, viewing photos, apps, games and typing. Smartphones , and what we consume on them, have moved on in the four years since a 4in iPhone was first unveiled, and the iPhone SE feels much less engaging than a 6S. It is much more pocketable, easier to grip and costs less, but it still isn’t a “budget” iPhone and is still relatively expensive compared to competing smartphones from other manufacturers. Pros: one-day battery, good rear camera, decent screen, easy to hold, easy to fit in a pocket, fits in existing iPhone 5 accessories Cons: very small screen, edges are hard on hands, looks like an iPhone 5 or 5S, selfie camera isn’t great, no expandable storage or removable battery Other reviews ',?
'It’s behind you… In the spotlight: capture your rear view with a Cycliq A few years ago some pro-cycling teams started using “saddle cams” to give fans an unprecedented rider’s-eye view of life in the peloton. Most of the cameras are fitted to the seat post and record what is happening behind the racer. The thrill of a bunch sprint is unbelievable – though you always end up feeling slightly sick watching the footage as you can only look backwards. Anyway, you can now record what happens behind you thanks to a new device from a firm called Cycliq . It began after a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014 and is now making the Fly6. It’s an HD camera combined with a very bright rear light. It costs £99. A forward-facing camera called the Fly12 will also soon be available. It’s incredibly easy to use. Plug it into your computer to charge it, clip it to your seat post and you have a usable rear light. However during the day you can use the same device to record all the action from the road. You get sound and great quality footage. The battery lasts for up to six hours and the camera can be used in any weather conditions. After your ride, flip out the tiny SD card and simply load and edit on your computer. There is clearly a safety aspect to this. I suppose when you get knocked off your bike you can later view the footage to see who hit you. I have taped a few commutes through central London and it is horrifying. I made the mistake of showing my wife and she is now trying to ban me from riding. I’d rather not know just how close those taxis were… However, I think you should use the Fly6 for much happier events. A weekend ride with your mates, maybe. What price to see the look on your friends’ faces as you pass them on a long climb? I’m heading for the hills this weekend and will certainly be capturing the fun… Cycliq, £99, is distributed exclusively in the UK by Raleigh ( cycliq.com ) Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @MartinLove166 ',?
'The exported image clearly lacks most of the lighter pen strokes, while the paper has shifted slightly while drawing, making some lines appear out of place. Sketch by Cheryl Pilbeam Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Price The Wacom Bamboo Spark costs £103 with either a gadget pocket, sleeve for a smaller tablet or a snap-fit case for an iPad Air 2 . It comes with two replacement ink cartridges and a 30-page notepad of relatively poor quality. Competing systems such as the Livescribe Smartpen 3 Black Edition cost £120, but require special paper starting at around £3 for a notepad and refills costing £1 each. Verdict The Wacom Bamboo Spark is just a few features away from being great. The idea is sound - make the back of the pad smart so you can use any paper. But the A5 pad is quite limited, it moves around causing issues for notes and drawings and the app-side of the pairing, where all your digital notes are processed, is not up to scratch. Unlike competitors there’s no audio recording capability, the handwriting recognition isn’t the best, but the pen, while feeling a bit cheap, is much closer to being a normal pen than most rivals. It’s also one of the cheapest solutions available and being able to export to Wacom’s digital inking format could be very useful for those looking to use it for more than just notetaking. Pros: can use any A5 paper, decent writing experience, simple to store and transfer inking, Wacom Ink Layer Language export Cons: small pad, bulky folio, cheap-feeling pen, page moves, no voice recording, limited app, exporting can be frustrating ',?
'Pinterest A headphones cable can be plugged in for wired listening. The small ‘N’ denotes the NFC area. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Simply put, battery life was stellar. They lasted well over 25 hours between charges with ANC on, meaning they’re in the range of being able to forget about charging them for your average daily listening. Charging took a good hour or so via microUSB. If the battery does run out you can use the headphones cable, which is also a lot easier to use than Bluetooth if you’re trying to connect to a computer. Observations The headphones socket is relatively narrow, which means I could only get the supplied cable to fit The headphones provide clear audible and voice feedback for connections and when it’s time to charge them, with a female voice with a strange US-Asian accent, which was difficult to place The LED flashes red to show the battery when switched on, or pressed when on. The headphones also audibly announce the battery life if you press the power button when they are already on. They fold up relatively compact, but not flat and have a shell carry case Call quality through the headphones was decent Price The Sony h.ear on Wireless NC headphones cost £220, which makes them £90 more than the Philips SHB9850NCs , £30 more than the Plantronics BackBeat Pro , but £79 cheaper than the Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones . Verdict The Sony h.ear on Wireless NC are a good set of Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones only slightly shy of excellent. They’re comfortable for extended periods, the battery life is very long and they have good controls. The noise cancelling isn’t quite as good as the best available, and their sound profile won’t suit everyone. I would have liked a little more sparkle and liveliness, something characteristic of good high-end headphones, but they make decent all-rounders for multiple music genres. They’re neither expensive nor cheap for wireless noise cancelling headphones and offer similar if not better performance than some much more expensive competitors making them definitely worth considering. Pros: great battery life, good controls, good connectivity, comfortable, noise cancelling, hi-res support, folding for travel Cons: passive isolation could be better, noise cancelling not quite as effective as high-end competitors ',?
'The remote lasts around a week of evening use per charge, or can just be left in its dock overnight. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian PS4 The one disappointing thing I’ve found with the Elite is with its control of Sony’s PlayStation 4 . The PS4 makes for a great media player and while the Elite can control some aspects of it, the remote can’t turn on the PS4, can’t control Netflix playback or some other bits. It also won’t turn it off, only putting it into sleep when you hit the power button. Logitech blames Sony for this, which insists that the primary driver is always the PS4’s controller, making for a lousy media experience. Observations It’s easier than I’d like to accidentally hit a button on the touchscreen when picking up the remote from the sofa Channel favourites remove the need to go hunting in the guide for BBC One in HD every time Trying to control pairs of Sonos speakers ends in one being turned up or down only, not both The Elite can send IR commands directly, if you need it to, which makes it easier to controll things in another room The shiny black Hub is a dust magnet Price The Logitech Harmony Elite is the top of the range remote from the company, costing £280. The Hub can be bought on its own for use with a smartphone for £100 or with a screen-less remote for £120, which is better value but not as convenient as not everything can be done from the remote. Verdict The Logitech Harmony Elite is the best do-it-all remote money can buy. It has few shortcomings and those that there are will normally be down to the device you’re trying to control rather than the remote itself, as is the case with the PS4. The biggest problem is the price: it is very expensive for a remote. Logitech’s Harmony Hub is where the real potential lies, with its ability to control pretty much anything and become an interface for IoT devices. Controlling your home entertainment is tedious with only a smartphone, however, as it’s never a single button push to get the job done and always takes longer than you’d like. For those that are annoyed by the plethora of remotes sitting on the coffee table and want something that just works, then the Elite is worth the price of entry. Pros: controls practically everything, no line-of-sight required, easy to set up with the app, can also use the app to control, IoT integration, ergonomic Cons: expensive, relatively easy to accidentally press a button on the touchscreen when picking up the remote, setup cannot be done directly on the remote ',?
'Share on WhatsApp ‘Sharing” is one of the most rhetorically abused virtues of the age. First we had the euphemism “file-sharing”, for duplicating and uploading copies of albums or films to the internet. Well, you can’t share what isn’t yours in the first place. (If I pilfer money from a bank and give it to my friends, I might plead that I was just “money-sharing”, but I am more likely to be convicted of robbery.) And now we supposedly have a “sharing economy”, the most-often cited two examples of which – Uber and Airbnb – are giant corporations pursuing monopoly power and fighting governments the world over. What exactly is being shared here, and in whose interest? The first “sharing economy” organisations allowed members to timeshare things such as cars or power tools, rather than owning one each and leaving it idle most of the time. In their purest form such groups were “peer-to-peer”: self-organising, with no central authority. Once a for-profit company is set up to handle the logistics – such as Zipcar – however, the notion of “sharing” is arguably already out of the window. Still, there remained the kernel of a communitarian idea in the origin of Airbnb, founded by two tech workers who rented out airbeds in their spare rooms for a conference, and thought there might be a market. Related: Beware the Airbnb guests who could end up costing you your home Airbnb’s marketing still plays on the feelings of virtuous and adventurous sociability in the idea of a “guest” staying in a spare room of the “host’s” home. Yet, as Tom Slee’s superbly argued book points out, the vast majority of Airbnb’s business is now “entire home” rentals: self-contained flats or villas. Long-term renters in cities such as San Francisco are being forced out by landlords who see more profit in short-term Airbnb stays. Slee performs some very clever data research and finds out that the most expensive Airbnb apartment in Rome is one of several European luxury pads rented out by an American tech entrepreneur, who bought them with the proceeds of the sale of his last software company. The idea of “sharing” is as meaningless here as it is in Uber’s made-up concept of “ride-sharing”, which sounds as ecologically minded as “car-sharing” but actually describes a taxi service. Nor is any “sharing” going on with companies such as TaskRabbit , in which people bid to perform other people’s odd jobs. What is explicitly not shared by any of the poster children of the “sharing economy” is responsibility. When something goes horribly wrong with an Airbnb or Uber transaction, the companies just say: “It wasn’t me.” (The mega-corporation is purportedly neither buyer nor seller but innocent middleman.) Slee has a brilliant chapter on how star-rating “reputation systems” between users simply don’t work, because people feel bad about giving low ratings even when they are amply deserved, so they all cluster between four and five. Instead, trust has to be enforced by authoritarian surveillance and discipline imposed by the company itself. Even so, the companies insist that they are not even providing a service; the websites and apps are just a “communications platform” to link buyers and sellers. (Even as they price-gouge the sellers, with Uber taking increasingly large cuts of up to 30% of a fare.) Nor, notoriously, does Uber consider its drivers to be employees to whom they would owe responsibilities: they are instead “independent contractors”. What all these artificial constructions amount to for Uber, Airbnb and the like is an attempt to bypass laws enacted over decades precisely in order to protect both renters and landlords, taxi drivers and passengers. Impressed by their popularity and financial clout, most lawmakers bend over backwards to accommodate them. Helpfully, California passed a special law recognising Uber and its competitors as “Transportation Network Companies”. In the face of complaints by London’s black-cab drivers, the high court ruled last year that an Uber driver’s smartphone is not a “taximeter” because the measurement of mileage through GPS signals and the calculation of the fare are done over the internet. This might strike some as a perversely creative refusal to acknowledge the plain meaning of the relevant legislation. The full definition of “taximeter” in the Private Hire Vehicles (London) Act of 1998 reads: “In this section ‘taximeter’ means a device for calculating the fare to be charged in respect of any journey by reference to the distance travelled or time elapsed since the start of the journey (or a combination of both).” None of this is to say that profitable pseudo-“sharing” operations cannot be set up to work in the best interests of everyone. The introduction of Paris’s cycle-hire scheme Vélib’ in 2007 was a great boon for residents of the city, and it now also has Autolib’, a very successful similar operation for electric cars. In the meantime, lots of us will continue to use Uber, too. To criticise it is not the sole preserve of people who are unqualified admirers of London cabbies’ high fares and habit of driving past in the rain. Slee points out, rightly, that his arguments are not about whether he or his readers actually use these services. In modern times we have been miseducated to believe that consumer choice is all-powerful, but the idea that consumers exercising their sovereign right to choose will always lead to the best outcomes is obviously in the interest of corporations seeking to escape official regulation. So, Slee uses Airbnb himself but backs the city authorities seeking to regulate it more tightly; and there is no contradiction in taking an Uber home from a party while wishing the company were better behaved. Only the law can force it to be so. ',?
'Review anything Microsoft Tay, Bodger & Badger, the sun, a chicken tikka Yorkshire pud – we review anything Every Friday we apply critical attention to things that don’t normally get it. This is an important function that might hold civilisation together. Or, more likely, not. Drop your suggestions for reviews in the comments or tweet them to @guideguardian Friday 1 April 2016 07.02 EDT Last modified on Friday 1 April 2016 11.06 EDT Pinterest Photograph: Microsoft Microsoft is dependable, familiar, solid. Pop by Cern or Nasa and they won’t be messing around with shiny Retina iMacs; they’ll be using Windows 95. Microsoft didn’t put its name on the Xbox because, well, it’s just not cool. So when it tries to get zeitgeisty, it rarely succeeds. A case in point: disgraced Twitter bot Tay, designed to pick up slang and trends, and endear Microsoft to the sort of youth clientele they haven’t had since the heady days of MSN. What they didn’t anticipate/care about when they launched Tay a week ago was that, in a world of trolling, revenge porn and screenshots of unflattering Snapchats, her millennial companions aren’t just chatting about the Kardashians. And so, she was given a crash course in being entirely repulsive by those who engaged with her online. Her bigoted missives – from “Bush did 9/11” to “Hitler did nothing wrong” – were swiftly deleted by Bill Gates’s minions, but the damage had already been done. Weirdly, the account sprang back into action a few days ago, to declare that she was smoking “kush” in front of the police. Sadly, this doesn’t appear to have been a piece of performance artistry masterminded by Shia LaBeouf, otherwise it would be getting a 10. 0/10 Pinterest Photograph: Alamy “Bodger and Badger are never far away”; if there’s a more ominous and troubling line in kids’ TV theme history I’m yet to hear it and, frankly, I don’t want to. Indeed, troubling is a fairly apt description of B&B, which over its 124 episodes tells the story of a deeply dysfunctional relationship between a handyman and his abusive, mashed potato-flinging badger. What a malicious character that Badger was – brooding, selfish and liable to snap at any minute. Quite why Bodger, the Carmela Soprano to Badger’s Tony, has tolerated his mammalian pal’s emotional, physical and carbohydrate-based bullying for more than two decades (even now the pair make appearances at music festivals and WKD-powered student nights) is beyond me. Equally baffling is the fact that I sat through this nasty, brutish and mercifully short carnival of misery week after week. The theme tune was rubbish and all. 2/10 One million Earths could fit inside the sun. The sun accounts for 99.86% of the solar system’s total mass. The surface of the sun is 5,550C and has the texture of a cat’s back. At its core the temperature is 15,000,000C and feels like moist cake. Contrary to popular beliefs largely propagated by the Teletubbies, a baby’s face does not actually exist in the sun. Extensive experiments conducted in 2004 aimed to test the sun-baby hypothesis, refuting it to the scientifically accepted p-value of <0.01. In lay terms, this means there is a less than 0.01% chance that a baby’s face does in fact exist in the sun. Thirty-two leading astrophysicists lost their sight in the controversial tests, as did three lab assistants and one curious passer-by. The sun has a diameter of 1,392,684km – 109 times that of Earth and 59,263 that of Leeds. The sun is hurtling through space at 220km/s, which equates to 792,000km/h or 0.07 times the speed of light. The speed is so ferocious that if you were to stand on the sun’s surface your hair would instantly turn into Jedward’s hair. It takes the sun 225-250 million years to orbit the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way’s centre. The sun has one of the strongest magnetic fields known to science. This is why currency is minted from non-magnetic metals. If it weren’t, it’s predicted that global economies would lose between 30% and 35% of GDP per annum in loose change being pulled into orbit – a phenomenon physicists call “anti-magnetospheric fiscal migration”, more commonly known as “coin ghosts”. The sun is an Aries. In summary: the sun is really great. 10/10 ',?

'Cyberwar Dark Territory review – how WarGames and Reagan shaped US cyberwar battle Slate columnist Fred Kaplan’s new book details – exhaustingly as well as exhaustively – the alarms and innovations that made mass surveillance Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy in 1983’s War Games. Photograph: Ronald Grant Sunday 20 March 2016 09.58 EDT Last modified on Sunday 20 March 2016 11.47 EDT Share on WhatsApp Ronald Reagan loved movies. One night in June 1983, he sat down at Camp David to watch WarGames . The film stars Matthew Broderick as a tech-wiz teenager who unwittingly hacks into the main computer at Norad, the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Thinking he has merely stumbled upon a new computer game, the hacker comes dangerously close to starting a third world war. Related: Zero Days review – a disturbing portrait of malware as the future of war Five days later, the president was in a meeting with the secretaries of state, defense and treasury, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and 16 senior members of Congress. They were there to discuss a new nuclear missile and the prospect of arms talks with the Russians. When Reagan began to give a detailed account of the plot of WarGames, eyes rolled. Then the president turned to John Vessey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, and asked: “Could something like this really happen?” One week later, General Vessey returned with a startling answer: “Mr President, the problem is much worse than you think.” Thus begins Dark Territory, Fred Kaplan’s important new book about the history of cyberwar. “When Reagan asked Vessey if someone could really hack into the military’s computers,“ Kaplan writes, “it was far from the first time the question had been asked.” It turned out that there was a good reason WarGames was so accurate: for their research the screenwriters had interviewed Willis Ware, who wrote a 1967 paper called Security and Privacy on Computer Systems and for years headed the computer science department at the RAND Corporation, an Air Force-funded think tank. Reagan’s casual inquiry set off the first of many efforts by the intelligence establishment to figure out a way to bolster America’s defensive and offensive cyber capabilities. Each is described in extreme detail in Kaplan’s new book. Kaplan is the national security columnist for Slate , and he generally does a good job of making even the most technical subjects accessible to the layman. Sometimes the particulars of bureaucratic infighting can be almost numbing, but whenever the narrative threatens to bog down the author manages to revive the reader’s interest. Take the practice attack the US carried out on itself in 1997, which penetrated the entire defense establishment network in four days, including the National Military Command Center, the facility that transmits orders from the president during wartime. In Kaplan’s words: “Most of the officers manning those servers didn’t even know they’d been hacked.” It turns out cyber warfare has been playing an important role in American warfare for longer than many would suspect. When General Eric Shinseki, the general in charge of Nato forces in Bosnia, realized his troops were being attacked by demonstrators stimulated by Serbian television stations, he managed to install remote control boxes on five transmitters. After that, whenever a newscaster started to promote a demonstration, Shinkseki’s men simply turned the TV signal off. The NSA’s Office of Tailored Access Operations created tools like ’something out of the most exotic James Bond movie’ When Michael Hayden became director of the National Security Agency, he created the Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO). It created tools resembling “something out of the most exotic James Bond movie”. These, Kaplan writes, included LoudAuto, which activated a laptop’s microphone to monitor all conversations in its vicinity; HowlerMonkey, which extracted and transmitted files via radio signals even if a computer wasn’t hooked up to the internet; MonkeyCalendar, which tracked a cellphone’s location; NightStand, which could load a computer with malware from several miles away; and RageMaster, which tapped into a computer’s video signal so a TAO technician could see whatever a target was watching. All of this escalating technological prestidigitation eventually merged with post 9/11 fears of terrorism to produce the spymaster’s dream, and what should have been the citizen’s ultimate nightmare – what Kaplan refers to a little too benignly as “a growing if somewhat resigned acceptance of intrusions into daily life”. This sea change was codified in the summer of 2007 by the passage of the Protect America Act , only eight days after George Bush proposed it in his weekly address. NSA director Keith Alexander was able to convince his colleagues it now made sense to “scoop up and store everything from everybody. NSA lawyers even altered some otherwise plain definitions, so that doing this didn’t constitute ‘collecting’ data from American citizens, which would be illegal: under the new terminology, the NSA was just storing the data, the collecting wouldn’t happen until an analyst went to retrieve it from the files …” These of course were the practices that largely remained hidden from view until, in June 2013, Edward Snowden performed the singular service of revealing “a massive data-mining operation, more vast than any outsider had imagined”. Related: NSA ’hacking unit’ infiltrates computers around the world – report It turned out, as Kaplan writes, that “the active surveillance of a single terrorist suspect could put a million people, possibly a million Americans, under [the NSA’s] watch. The revelation came as a shock, even to those who otherwise had few qualms about the occasional breach of personal privacy”. But instead of increasing our security, such methods have simply created a new form of mutually assured destruction. Congress has been told that China and “probably one or two other countries” are definitely inside the networks that control America’s power grids, waterworks and other critical assets. And though no American official has said so in public, America is also inside the networks “that controlled such assets in other countries”. “Would burrowing more deeply deter an attack, or would it only tempt both sides, all sides to attack the others’ networks preemptively?” These, Kaplan writes, were the questions that “some tried to answer but no one ever did” during the nuclear confrontations of the cold war. Now we face exactly the same questions, with no good answers for them. Charles Kaiser is the author 1968 In America, The Gay Metropolis and, most recently The Cost of Courage. ',?

'Eight technologies that could change healthcare beyond recognition Smartphones, genome sequencing and wearable technology will bring benefits but also challenges to health and social care Smartphones can serve as the hub for new diagnostic and treatment technologies. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Supported by Researcher in policy at the King’s Fund Friday 15 April 2016 04.45 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 08.31 EDT Share on WhatsApp 1. The smartphone Although not new, the smartphone’s potential is yet to be realised in health and care. Efforts to curate quality apps, for example through an NHS app library, have had little success. Sophisticated apps can fit into health services. Ginger.io offers people with depression or anxiety problems the ability to track their mood and share data with clinicians to offer interventions. Smartphones can serve as the hub for new diagnostic and treatment technologies. Some people with type 1 diabetes, dissatisfied with medical technology companies’ progress, are driving forward the development of an artificial pancreas. Their ubiquity also makes them ideal to gather large amounts of data to improve understanding of disease at a population level. BigPD is a project seeking to sign up 100,000 people to track their health and develop new insights into Parkinson’s disease. 2. At-home or portable diagnostics Clinicians can bring hospital-level diagnostics to the home through portable x-ray machines, blood-testing kits and other technologies. Patients can use tools like the AliveCOR ECG , embedded in a smartphone case, which helps interpret heart test results via an app and facilitates sharing with clinicians. Some people with disabilities or long-term conditions use assistive devices to help them perform certain tasks or activities. Assisted devices could have embedded sensors capable of gathering data on their use. A tremor spoon is already on the market for use by people with Parkinson’s disease. By incorporating sensors and deploying its data analytic expertise, the aim is to understand how someone’s disease changes over time. 3. Implantable drug-delivery mechanisms Between a third and a half of all medication prescribed to people with long-term conditions is not taken as recommended. Several technologies in development could enable patients and care professionals to monitor and improve adherence to a prescribed drug regime. There is sensor technology so small it can be swallowed and combined with drugs in pill form. When the pill dissolves in the stomach, the sensor is activated and transmits data via a wearable patch to a smartphone app. Patients and clinicians can see how well they are adhering to their prescription, though it raises important questions about patients’ privacy and autonomy. 4. Digital therapy Digital therapeutics are health or social care interventions delivered through a smartphone or a laptop. They embed clinical practice and therapy into a digital form. Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) A new generation of automated digital therapies has been developed that aims to deliver CBT at scale with better engagement. Sleepio is one example, a six-week tailored programme delivered through the web designed to treat insomnia and help alleviate anxiety and depression. There have been positive early results in randomised controlled trials. 5. Genome sequencing Advances in genome sequencing and the associated field of genomics will give us better understanding of how diseases affect different individuals. With the genetic profile of a person’s disease and knowledge of their response to treatment, it should be possible to better predict their response to treatment. Population-level studies Major projects are underway internationally to understand the relationship between genes and health at a population scale. In the UK, the government is sponsoring the 100,000 Genomes project in England. In the US, one company promises to build a database featuring 1m genomes by 2020 and currently has 20,000 sequenced genomes linked to other data about people’s physical characteristics. 6. Artificial intelligence Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed, meaning they can teach themselves to change when exposed to new data. New insights into big datasets Several businesses hope to use these techniques to provide diagnostic support. Enlitic, IBM’s Watson division and Google’s Deep Mind have started to explore potential applications in healthcare. 7. Blockchains Blockchains are decentralised databases that keep a record of how data is created and changed over time. Their key feature is they can be trusted as authoritative records without a single, central authority guaranteeing accuracy and security. Electronic health records are widely used, but they are usually centralised, provided by a small number of suppliers. Some commentators have described how records using blockchain technology would bring benefits like resilience and encourage interoperability, with the patient or clinician given the encryption keys to control who sees the data. 8. Online communities Social networks like MedHelp , PatientsLikeMe and HealthUnlocked bring together people with interests in health and care to support each other, share learning and even provide a platform for tracking health data, helping people manage their condition and contributing to research. With new technologies like these come new opportunities for our health and care system: improving the accuracy and usefulness of information we can gather on our health as citizens and patients; changing how and where care is delivered; and offering new ways to prevent, predict, detect and treat illness. Challenges include how to ensure universal access to the benefits of technologies through the NHS . The system needs to get better at dealing with the great volume of health information these technologies generate. This is an abridged version of an article that first appeared on kingsfund.org.uk .

'sustainable food UK farmers to test hi-tech beans that could prevent food waste As agriculture invests more in big data, tech veteran Andrew Holland is getting ready to test his small sensor device in grain silos Andrew Holland sees farmers as the perfect test market for his monitoring device, which he will trial in the summer. Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images This content is supported by sponsors. Jesse Hirsch Friday 15 April 2016 01.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 01.07 EDT Share on WhatsApp When it comes to the internet of things (IoT), the fanfare is often around items like fridges, cars, and entire skyscrapers . But one entrepreneur is thinking small, producing highly-connected devices the size of a bean. BeanIoT is the brainchild of tech veteran Andrew Holland, who says that the size and shape of a bean (roughly 45mm by 18mm) makes it ideal as a versatile, low-profile monitoring device. Picture a bean in your pocket while you work out, assessing your progress and vital signs without a clunky wrist device. In an assisted living facility, beans could monitor whether residents had fallen or were in medical distress. Or in a grain silo, strategically scattered beans could assess temperature, moisture and CO2, to gauge potential problem areas before they develop. By late summer this year, the BeanIoT prototypes will be placed in silos around Cambridgeshire, where Holland’s company RFMOD is headquartered. Holland has chosen agriculture as the tester partly because Cambridgeshire is a large grain-producing area and his brother is a farmer, but he also believes farmers make the ideal test market. “Farmers are some of the most practical people in the world,” says Holland. “They aren’t going to invest in anything unless they can see a clear return on investment. They’ll be the perfect judges.” Depending on how the testing goes, Holland wants the product to hit the market in the next three to five years. The idea arrives as big data becomes an area of focus in agriculture. Companies like Monsanto are investing in tech that can monitor soil quality or climatic shifts with remarkable levels of precision. According to Holland, silo technology currently involves monitoring devices hanging from wires. The wireless systems that do exist are costly, running into thousands of dollars , and therefore often beyond the reach of smaller growers. The final goal is to get each BeanIoT costing less than $30 (£20). Related: Can agriculture giant Monsanto’s data biz help the environment? BeanIoT, as Holland envisions it, will be like a highly specific early warning system. Long before your grains start to mould, the network of beans (the more you have, the more specific your readings) will alert you to excess humidity. Or the CO2 monitor will pick up on insect breath before an infestation gets rampant. All this observed data can be monitored from the remote comfort of a farmer’s laptop. ',?

You are then able to rate how accurately it has detected what was on display. It learns from the rating, and in theory, the captions get better. The bot, from Microsoft’s Cognitive Services team , is the result of some hefty research into how to model objects in photographs so that a computer can understand them. They claim that their system can recognise “a broad range of visual concepts” and also performs entity extraction so that it can recognise celebrities. Which it clearly can do. Pinterest Taylor Swift and Kanye West both identified in Microsoft’s CaptionBot app. Photograph: Microsoft It incorporates three separate services to process the images. The Computer Vision API identifies the components of the photo, it mixes that with data from the Bing Image Search API , and runs any faces it spots through their Emotion API . This analyses human facial expressions to detect anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness or surprise. Other services produced by the group include “ How Old Do I Look ” and the “ What Dog? ” robot. Of course, we immediately tested CaptionBot by uploading pictures from Doctor Who, with admittedly very little success. Pinterest A picture of some sort. Well spotted CaptionBot.

Kate Lyons meets the people who make the Guardian’s comment threads tick Top row l-r Peter Cox-Smith, Hilary Sutcliffe, Michael Cosgrove, Rupert Harwood, bottom row l-r Daniel Waweru, Stuart Ellis, Caroline Gatti and Sue Smith. Photograph: The Guardian for the Guardian Thursday 14 April 2016 06.01 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 15.11 EDT Share on WhatsApp The Guardian’s web we want series has taken a look at the darker side of online conversations , but most commenters bring insight, knowledge and enthusiasm to the debate. Nine of the best explain what keeps them coming back to the threads below the line. Sue Smith School science technician, 50, York. Comments on: politics, sex and love, food. Username: Orbitalgirl Whereas most commenters tend to focus their energies on one area of the site, Sue Smith has decidedly eclectic commenting habits. She is equally likely to be found below the line of food and lifestyle stories and the love and sex advice columns – “I like to reassure people that they’re normal,” she says – and political articles, particularly those about Jeremy Corbyn. “Jeremy represents what in my opinion the Labour party was founded for,” she says. “When he was elected I could have cried, I was so excited.” Smith says that while the tone of comments under the lifestyle and love sections tends to be “warm, open and quite kind”, articles about politics tend to attract comments that are “much harsher, much more cut and thrust”. Pinterest Sue Smith, from York, is one of the most frequent BTL commentors on the Guardian website. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian This does not bother Smith, who says she will often intervene if she sees someone “getting flamed” by others on the site. “I will step in and defend them because it’s just online bullying. It’s so easy to be a keyboard warrior.” For Smith, commenting appeals because it allows her to give her opinion, participate in a community and respond to her favourite writers. “I have a bit of a crush on Jay Rayner. But my favourite thing is Rhik [Samadder] and his gadgets . I set a reminder on Rhik’s contributions. He has a very large female following. I love him,” says Smith. “I’m the kitchen gadget queen and I do own a few things he’s reviewed. The burger thing he did the other week, the things he said were exactly the things I thought about it.” Michael Cosgrove Pinterest Michael Cosgrove writes up to 50 comments a day on the Guardian website. Photograph: Fabrice Caterini / Inediz for the Guardian Michael Cosgrove estimates that he comments on the Guardian site “six and a half days a week”, writing up to 50 comments a day. Since he started engaging below the line in 2009, Cosgrove says, his attitude towards commenting has changed dramatically. “When I started, as soon as I was confronted with aggression I gave as much as I got. But I’ve changed that over the years,” he says. The turning point for Cosgrove came a few years ago when one of his comments was moderated – deemed inappropriate and removed from the site – and he was given a temporary ban from commenting. “I deserved it. I should’ve known better. I’d probably been drinking. It was a bloody horrible experience and a bloody good lesson. I thought, ‘You’ve got to do better boy, you’re nearly 60!’ I wrote to [the moderators] and said, ‘I’m so sorry,’ and they let me off, they were very lenient with me.” Now Cosgrove feels a responsibility, as someone who has been part of the commenting community for a long time, to keep things civil. “You’ve just got to try and persuade people that there’s a responsible way to comment. I think we owe it to ourselves, particularly those of us who have been on there for a while.” He says he has watched other commenters change their style too: “I think you learn how to comment, I honestly believe that, and I’ve seen it happen with others. I’ve seen people mellow out.” Caroline Gatti Caroline Gatti, commentator on feminist issues. Photograph: Christophe Viseux for the Guardian Caroline Gatti began commenting five years ago when she was working as a teacher in Oman. “Rural Oman doesn’t have a lot going on in the evening so I rediscovered the joy of free time. I was reading more and getting into hobbies; I got a chance to dedicate more time to the Guardian,” says Gatti. Gatti was a careful and amused reader of the comment threads under articles for quite a while before she took the plunge and began commenting herself. “The comments were funny, wise at times, informative. With comments, you get a 360-degree take on an event all on one page, whereas in the past to get different viewpoints you’d have to go to different newspapers. That was what got me hooked as a reader. “I noticed there were more women’s issues being discussed and they were attracting quite a – shall I say – vivacious discussion. Feminism is one of the things I do know a bit about, being a feminist, so I waded in.” Gatti describes commenting on articles addressing gender equality as “exasperating” and “a bit tiring” and over the past five years has taken several breaks from commenting for months at a time when she’s found things too upsetting. Particularly annoying to Gatti is the fact that so many people will argue that it is a waste of time to write about what they see as more minor manifestations of sexism when grosser injustices exist. “It seems that before you get to talk about the topic you have to justify why you should be able to talk about that issue. Yes we know that female genital mutilation exists, but that doesn’t mean this isn’t important. Like, you don’t get people going into the football [articles] and saying: ‘Why are you talking about this frivolous thing when there’s famine and war?’” Although she says her voice is a “drop in the ocean”, she hopes that she can inspire others with her comments. “My hope is someone else who’s sitting at home reading, who is sitting on the fence, might say: ‘What she has said isn’t out of order, she makes a good point, maybe I’m a feminist too.’” Daniel Waweru Pinterest Daniel Waweru took up commentating while studying for his PhD. Photograph: Tony Karumba for the Guardian Daniel Waweru attended university – at undergraduate, master’s and PhD level – in the UK, and it was during his PhD research that he took up commenting in a serious way. “I had a spell of about three or four years where I commented pretty regularly. One of the things that led me to comment was seeing there was a bunch of misconceptions about something I know a lot about. I remember there was stuff about Mau Mau [the uprising that took place between 1952 and 1960 when Kenya was under British colonial rule] – it seemed a lot of people hadn’t kept up with the research.” Waweru said that things could get a little heated below the line and at one point he was temporarily banned by moderators for a comment he wrote. Though he confesses he got around the ban by creating a second account under a pseudonym. “I was put in the sin bin. There was a heated discussion about Churchill. I said something about him being a war criminal and that didn’t go down well: somebody reported me. They had a point, I could have said what I wanted in a less inflammatory manner. “I think moderation is essential. It would be nice if people could handle themselves without oversight, but it just doesn’t work like that, not on the internet. I don’t always agree with it, but they get it right at least as often as they get it wrong.” Waweru has kept up with UK news since returning to Kenya in 2013, regularly reading the Guardian, the Times and the Telegraph, but his commenting has tapered off. “Work can be crazy, so I thought something has to give and it was the commenting. But very occasionally, if something catches my eye, I’ll say something.” Rupert Harwood Pinterest Rupert Harwood: ‘I think there’s a real community there which stretches beyond the Guardian website.’ Photograph: Gareth Philips for the Guardian “My first comment was a slightly drunken rant against the coalition government, which I posted when I got in from a night out with a group of Tory friends,” says Rupert Harwood. “Their triumphalism pretty much pushed me over the edge and by the time I got home I was ready to join the online fightback against the government.” Harwood says he must have clocked up thousands of comments over the years, commenting every time he took a tea break from his PhD research, “which, not having the best concentration in the world, was about every 30 minutes”, he admits. Though commenting has been a big part of Harwood’s life since that infuriating night with his Tory friends in December 2011, in January he was forced to take a break when he developed severe tinnitus. “It has had a devastating impact on my life. I was meant to be writing up an 80,000-word thesis but the constant noise has made it hard to concentrate on writing a shopping list. And one of the casualties for now has been commenting on the Guardian.” Noticing his absence below the line, many other commenters reached out to Harwood and sent him messages of encouragement. “Some of the leftie Guardian posters asked why I haven’t been posting and they have been very supportive. I think there’s a real community there which stretches beyond the Guardian website. “I intend to return very soon and know that things will be looking up when I do.” Stuart Ellis Pinterest Stuart Ellis uses his experience of standup comedy when engaging in verbal jousts. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian Stuart Ellis has the same approach to commenting online that he had when he used to do standup comedy. “I used to like being heckled because it gave me a chance to fire back and because I knew the audience were engaged,” says Ellis. “If it’s just abuse I tend to screen it because it’s the internet: it’s like complaining about smog in Beijing, it’s never going to go away. But other times you put your visor down and you’re like, ‘We’re going to spar’.” Ellis seems to enjoy initiating the verbal jousts himself with a quick, occasionally biting wit. Why does he comment on the Guardian site? “It’s the only way to get a decent conversation in Essex,” he quips. Sometimes though, the conversation about current issues baffles him. The Brexit campaign, for example, to his mind makes Britain look like “a tiny island with lots of angry old people on it that inexplicably ran a global empire. It’s a bit HMS Pinafore. I think at any moment the whole government could burst into song.” Ellis comments on the Guardian 10 times a day, six or seven days a week, often on the politics live blog , which he describes as “somewhere between an old saloon bar and a Parisian salon. You get some high-brow commenters who reference the Byzantine empire and some people who come in to sling abuse.” It is the robust intellectual debate that Ellis likes so much about commenting, which he says has become for him “an old hobby, like stamp collecting”. “I get to test my own reasoning and see other people bat it down and make sure I’m not going crazy,” he says. “It’s the continuing process of being proved wrong that I enjoy. I will make a statement, events will transpire and I will say, ‘Well, I was wrong about that.’ It’s a sort of intellectual sadomasochism. Hilary Sutcliffe Pinterest Hilary Sutcliffe says commenting on the running blog is like having a diary. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian When Hilary Sutcliffe was 52 she ran for a bus, the first running she had done in years, and discovered that it was considerably easier because she had recently lost a few stone. She bought a running book, did her first 10k then discovered the Guardian’s running blog and started commenting underneath the articles. “It was a midlife crisis thing. Some people leave their husbands, I took up running,” says Sutcliffe. On the running blog, every Monday a post asks: “How was your weekend running?” and below the line several hundred comments appear from runners who share their triumphs, injuries and moments of laziness. “It’s like having a diary. You see your own ups and downs and other people’s ups and downs. I make myself say something every week just for accountability purposes. I can’t say: ‘I’ve done sod all because I’ve been too lazy.’ One time I was going to tell them I did a half marathon when I didn’t, but I thought, ‘I just can’t lie,’ so I got out there and trained,” says Sutcliffe. Sutcliffe says the community has been invaluable during her running career: “There are so many good people on there.” Earlier this year, when she decided to give up running it was the running blog community that kept her going. “Eight or 10 of them said, ‘No, you’re an inspiration.’ I thought, ‘What are you talking about? I’m on the slow end and the old end,’ but people said they’re so pleased to have someone on the slow end and the old end,” says Sutcliffe. “I wouldn’t be running if they weren’t there. If it wasn’t for them I’d be living a cushy life having a lovely time, but I’m now out in the cold running.” Tim Middleton Pinterest Tim Middleton posts about six comments a day on the Guardian website. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian When Tim Middleton started commenting in 2007, he was initially drawn to articles on politics and the editorial cartoon. “There’s a definite community of interest there. We all get very disappointed if comments don’t open up straight away.” He estimates posting about six comments a day – “sometimes a little more at weekends” – and confesses: “Very occasionally I’ll sneak over to the Telegraph and scrawl on their table.” Middleton mostly comments under political stories, but also on stories related to the arts, the insurance industry (in which he works) and adoption which, as he has a five-year-old adoptive daughter, is a subject he is particularly passionate about. Middleton has seen a huge range of events occur: “I remember when the News of the World closed and there were a lot very important articles about that. Over the period I’ve been commenting that was one of the most interesting and most intense periods of comments and I remember writing a comment: ‘It’s the Guardian wot won it’, which got a good reaction.” While he says people “react sympathetically” a lot of the time below the line, particularly on subjects such as adoption, he is unimpressed by “unpleasant developments” in the world of commenting. “There’s been a tendency towards astroturfing,” he says, referring to commenters sent en masse by a lobby group or government but made to look like a grassroots movement. Middleton says he has noticed this in particular when the Guardian runs an anti-Vladimir Putin story. He’s also concerned by what he sees as an uptick in the number of Islamophobic comments. “That’s a particularly disturbing development. That didn’t happen eight, nine years ago, but there’s some serious trolling going on these days which is far more pronounced than it used to be.” Peter Cox-Smith Pinterest Peter Cox-Smith mostly comments on politics. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian Peter Cox-Smith says he has been writing to the Guardian since the mid-1970s. “I used to write letters to the editor, so I’ve been writing to the Guardian for years.” It took Cox-Smith a while to get the hang of the different style required for commenting online. “When you write a letter you tend to make more of an argument. That kind of thing is harder to do online. If you write something that’s long people tend to ignore it, but if you write something short and snappy you get a response,” he says. Cox-Smith mostly comments on politics and expresses a “Liberal Democrat view”, which he guesses is a minority viewpoint on the Guardian – though he says he enjoys being challenged by people. “I’ve definitely changed my mind on things. I won’t take someone’s opinion, but if they say, ‘Go away and read this’ and make a serious suggestion, I’ll do that. There was a big debate about privatisation of the NHS during the coalition time, so I went off and read lots of material. I don’t like the idea of full-blown privatisation, but I think that the government is very bad at running the NHS and it made me feel a bit more inclined to say that the NHS does still need to change a lot,” he says. Cox-Smith is not as prolific as some commenters on the site, posting three or four times a week, mostly on the politics live blog . But he has been commenting for a long time – joining up in 2005. “I was thinking about this: why do I do it? Do I do it because I think it’ll make a difference? I suppose I do believe it does make a difference. I don’t have any influence, but I do have ideas. If you keep putting the ideas out there you have to believe it’ll make a difference.” How we chose the commenters Top commenters were selected by cross-referencing a list of the commenters who had the highest average of “recommends per comment” with a list of those with the highest percentage of “staff picks”. People who appeared on both lists, indicating their comments were well-regarded by both other readers and Guardian staff, were approached about participating. A number either did not respond, or replied that they did not wish to participate, almost without exception because they wished to remain anonymous. To supplement that list, moderators then identified communities in which good BTL conversations frequently took place and approached several commenters from them about participating. Those they contacted comment regularly and have been commenting for a reasonable length of time. In all of these communities, there were many commenters we could have approached. How to comment Signing up to comment on Guardian articles is easy. Go to the “ Create your Guardian account page ” and simply fill out the form (there’s a link to it next to the top of the comments on articles where the commenting facility is turned on as well). You will need to give yourself a user name and you can add an avatar picture – but you don’t have to. Once you are signed in, click on the “join the discussion...” box under an article with comments turned on, write your words of wisdom, hit the “Post your comment” button and you’re away. You will need javascript turned on in your browser. This FAQ deals with many of the common issues about commenting and moderation. This article was amended on 14 April 2016 to clarify that Daniel Waweru commenced PhD studies in the UK, but did not complete them. ',?
'Share on WhatsApp How shitty are men really? The question hung in the air, invisible but omnipresent, like the smell of a garbage fire from a nearby town. By 2016, a series of catchphrases had come to dominate the chaotic state of gender politics – “male privilege”, “rape culture”, “men’s rights” – but confusion reigned. And in the middle of this confusion, a group of anonymous men retreated to The Red Pill , an online community hosted on Reddit, to revel in their loathing. The name derives from a scene in the 1999 film The Matrix, in which Laurence Fishburne offers Keanu Reeves a choice: “You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” The rabbit hole, in this case, is the “reality” that women run the world without taking responsibility for it, and that their male victims are not permitted to complain. This makes The Red Pill a continuous, multi-voiced, up-to-the-minute male complaint nestled at the heart of the so-called manosphere – a network of websites preoccupied with both the men’s rights movement and how to pick up women. The manosphere’s most hateful opinions tend to generate the most attention – like Roosh V’s notion that it should be legal to rape a woman on private property (a bit of hateful stupidity which he later claimed to be parody). In February, Roosh V attempted to organise a meet-up of like-minded men on the grounds of the provincial legislature in Toronto, but he had to cancel the event when a local band of female boxers threatened to disrupt the event with violence. But judging The Red Pill by the most extreme statements of its members is, if not unfair, then at least inaccurate. There is plenty of vileness, to be sure – elaborate conspiracy theories formed out of pure misogyny and outright hatred of female independence. But the bulk of the comments are much more muted and, frankly, pathetic. In the hours upon hours I spent wandering this online neighbourhood, I saw mostly feral boys wandering the digital ruins of exploded masculinity, howling their misery, concocting vast nonsense about women, and craving the tiniest crumb of self-confidence and fellow-feeling. The discussion threads are a mixed bag of rage and curiosity: screeds against feminists, advice on how to masturbate less, theories on why women fantasize about rape, descriptions of arguments with girlfriends, guides to going up to strangers on the street, and, most of all, workout schedules and diet regimes. Reading The Red Pill, then, offers two possible answers to the question “how shitty are men really?” The first situates The Red Pill as another toxic technoculture on a spectrum of digital misogyny: on Twitter, any woman who says anything even moderately controversial will receive torrents of direct physical threats as a matter of course. Sites such as 4chan exist mainly to post thousands of revenge porn images without consent. Gamers on Xbox Live will be sexually harassed , inevitably. The answer to the question of how shitty men are, from this perspective, is “really pretty shitty”. But an entirely different approach emerges with a slight shift in emphasis: how shitty are men really? That is, how does these men’s behaviour online translate into non-digital life ? The Red Pill poses one of the absolute conundrums of our time: are we our real selves on the internet, or are we not? ••• The head moderator of The Red Pill goes by the handle Morpheus Manfred, and when he agreed to give me an interview it was only by online chat. Anonymity is sacred; facelessness is the sacrifice it demands. He moderates the community’s 141,966 (and counting) members, and like most of them, describes himself as white, early 30s, male and conservative (he would have preferred Rand Paul to Donald Trump, but he likes Trump’s “watch-it-burn” style). I ask him what event led him to The Red Pill (his answers have been edited for length). Morpheus Manfred: Having spent my 20s looking for female companionship, I noticed that the dating game wasn’t what I was taught – what my parents prepared me for, and what I learned from movies. It was stacked against guys, and it was a very unpleasant experience. Me: Can you give me an example? Morpheus Manfred: Over the past 10 years, the flakiness of women has gotten worse. You’d meet a girl, hit it off, get her number and agree to a date. And either she’d no-show, or cancel right before. I found myself putting in all this effort for nothing, it was very defeating. It’s not the way courting worked when my parents met. What I saw in movies – where having a good heart and being yourself is all you need – that’s not what happens now. Good and nice aren’t attractive any more. The manosphere fundamentally became a surrogate father for the life lessons I never got. We wanted a place where men could discuss masculine topics without facing the same public shaming outcry that happens on social media sites – feminists are quick on the trigger to try to take down anything they consider wrong … Milo Yiannopoulos lost his verified status on Twitter because of his views on masculinity. It’s a big topic that has become taboo in our culture. Me: But surely there’s a line somewhere. I mean, the real feelings being expressed here are hostility to women. Morpheus Manfred: We’re accused of misogyny almost daily. I won’t deny that the language is colorful and there’s a lot of emotion expressed by the men on the forum. But [before The Red Pill] there wasn’t really a way for guys to express these feelings. Let’s say there’s a guy who just says “I hate women” – I think that’s textbook misogyny. We let them say that. Because there’s nowhere else for a man to blow off steam. But they stay, they learn, they vent, they get advice, they get back on the horse. The endgame of our advice isn’t to hate women. It’s to understand them so you can stop being so darn frustrated by them. Morpheus claims that The Red Pill helped him find a longtime girlfriend, and that The Red Pill is ultimately little more than an online version of locker-room talk. ••• It’s funny, because Jessica, my editor at the Guardian, had the same idea. Wasn’t The Red Pill just an updated version of locker-room talk? No, I said, it’s nothing like locker-room talk. Well, she asked, what’s locker-room talk like, then? Locker-room talk goes like this: you say to your friend, my God, did you see the tits on that yoga instructor, and your friend says, it hurts you, doesn’t it, and you say it does, it does, and he says you know I’ve sucked tits like that before, and you say yeah right and he says really and you say who and he says in Brazil and you say of course it would be an unverifiable claim, and he shrugs and you laugh and he laughs. The quantity of locker-room talk is inversely proportional to familiarity with women. So, as you fall in love, maybe even get married, it no longer becomes feasible to talk with friends about women’s bodies in such specific detail because, say, your friend works for your wife, and you don’t want him thinking about her cleavage when she’s firing him. But very quickly – mid-30s, really – a new locker-room talk emerges. The new locker-room talk goes like this: you ask your friend what summer programming do you have your daughters in, and your friend says I’m trying to find something with science in it, and you say, yeah, you gotta fight those cultural assumptions about girls and STEM, and he says totally, and you say I’m just trying to do little things like nature walks and trips to the science center, and he says we should go together some time, and you say totally. And then you’re taking your daughters to the science center and a gorgeous woman walks by, and you look at your friend, and your friend looks at you, and you don’t have to say a thing. I’m not saying this is the way it should be. Frankly, it’s humiliating for everybody involved. But there is a truth there: if you have a working dick and a working soul, you’d better get used to living with contradictions. It is exactly this capacity for contradiction that the boys of The Red Pill lack so utterly. Their humourlessness is impressive, given that they mostly post comments about the minutiae of sexual dynamics, which is the substance of almost all comedy. ••• Under “I fucked up. How to fix?” Red Pill member AspireToBeGreater requested some advice from the group. He had met a girl. She was all smiley during their initial conversation. But then “I horribly botched an attempt to ask her out for drinks because I got nervous. I pulled back and tried to rebuild my frame over a couple weeks.” She was still giving off signs of interest, notably showing him pictures of her dogs. “I have since asked her to get coffee in a much more casual way, she had a legit excuse and I couldn’t read much from her response.” Should he keep pushing? The Red Pill poses one of the absolute conundrums of our time: are we our real selves on the internet, or are we not? The replies came to a rapid consensus. A commenter noted: “She’s turned you down twice, which means she’s almost certainly not interested.” Another added: “Most likely she’s just not that into you if she doesn’t even suggest an alternative date.” The above is a fairly typical post. The Red Pill grinds away at the confusions of contemporary masculinity, both real and imagined. The intellectual foundation of The Red Pill is its glossary – a shared language of complaint and insight. So we have, for example: Alpha – Socially dominant. Somebody who displays high value, or traits that are sexually attractive to women. SMV – Sexual Market Value. A shorthand statement for “what you bring to the table”, whether for a one-night stand or for a longer relationship. HB – Hot Babe (often followed by a ranking on a 1-10 scale). AF/BB - Alpha Fucks/Beta Bucks. AF/BB, as an idea, is closely related to AWALT (“All Women Are Like That”). All women, in this argument, divide men into two types: alpha males they want to fuck, and beta males they use for financial and emotional support in exchange for sex. Definitions like these run into the dozens. Their primary purpose is clarity, obviously. More than lust or hatred, the boys of The Red Pill hunger for clarity. They desire escape from confusion. They desire a system with which to comprehend desire itself. Don’t we all? ••• In real life, I knew a man once who was the exact opposite of The Red Pill in every regard, and he shattered everything that I believed I knew about men. Never did he say the least inappropriate thing, at least around me. No locker room talk for him. He had graduated from York University, the most politically correct university in Canada, with a minor in women’s studies. He proudly called himself a feminist, and he was called a feminist proudly by others. In his job as the most prominent radio host at the CBC, the national broadcaster, he had become an icon of the new multicultural and egalitarian Toronto. That man was Jian Ghomeshi, who was on 25 March acquitted in three cases of sexual assault and choking after the testimony of the complainants collapsed . Before Ghomeshi, I thought I knew more or less how men worked. I thought – it’s embarrassing to say – I thought I was a close observer of people. I liked Jian; I cannot deny it. We weren’t close – we met during the time in life when you don’t form new friendships so much as respectful allegiances – but he was fun, pleasant. And yet I remember a lovely spring wedding in Toronto where the guests, mostly media people, sat around bitching and gossiping as media people do. I made some flip remark about Jian dying his hair. Then I saw The Face pass over one of the young women at my table. I would see The Face several times with several different women when the subject of Jian came up – a half-suppressed deflation, a furtive darkening. The other women told me nothing; The Face simply came and went. But at this wedding, the young woman with The Face did not let her suffering fade into the general background; she leaned in and told me the story of how he had said to her “ I just want to hate-fuck you to wake you up ” while at work. I certainly remained friendly with Jian after I heard this story. Why? I have no good answer. The best answer I have is that I have been trained not to judge people on the basis of their sexual tastes. That’s my inclination but it’s also been my education. I refrained from judging him, half-consciously. Throughout Ghomeshi’s trial, as his lawyer Marie Heinen ripped apart the accusers , I found myself recalling a line from Philip Roth’s The Human Stain, set during the halcyon years when America’s biggest problem was the president’s joint taste for cigars and interns. More than lust or hatred, the boys of The Red Pill hunger for clarity “I myself dreamed of a mammoth banner,” Roth wrote, “draped dadaistically like a Christo wrapping from one end of the White House to the other and bearing the legend A HUMAN BEING LIVES HERE.” That phrase should have been draped over the Toronto courtroom. The accusers responded like human beings, so they forgot to tell things to the police. They forgot their Hotmail passwords. They communicated with each other and with Jian. One of them wrote: “You have beautiful hands.” They responded in a way consistent with the inconsistency of human sexuality, caught in the mess of desire and its justification. Much has been written about how the Ghomeshi trial has revealed various aspects of our culture and society – the failures of the criminal justice system, or the reality of rape culture, or the impotence of fourth-wave feminism. The Ghomeshi trial has revealed nothing. It has only obscured. ••• “Rape culture” is a nebulous term, but it remains that men who want to treat women as if they are nothing have ample scope to express that desire – online and offline both. Culture, insofar as it is popular, poses the same question over and over: how cool does a guy have to be before he can treat women like they’re nothing? When Kesha tried to escape her contract with Doctor Luke, the producer whom she claims raped her, the judge gave the ruling which applies to the music industry as a whole in 2016: “My instinct is to do the commercially reasonable thing.” Kanye West was able proclaim Bill Cosby’s innocence and release The Life of Pablo with the line “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that bitch famous.” And it didn’t matter; Kanye was way too cool. It was performance. Or it was subversion. It was something, anyway, that made it totally different than some ordinary guy saying that Taylor Swift was a bitch he made famous and so could have sex with her. A critic for the New Yorker described the Swift line as “a throwaway boast on an otherwise good song”. ',?
'Facebook Facebook has a new army of chatbots – but what can you do with them? From news and stock prices to shopping and even fiction, Facebook Messenger’s new bots want to change our messaging Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg unveiling his company’s plans for messaging bots.

Great. But what can you actually do with them? In the short term, many chatbots are basically glorified search boxes. It’s very early days, judging by the first wave of Facebook Messenger bots, which launched its chatbot platform this week . I’ve been chatting to six of them, and most provide information and links in response to keywords and/or selections from multiple-choice menus. Wall Street Journal ',?
'The web we want The dark side of Guardian comments As part of a series on the rising global phenomenon of online harassment, the Guardian commissioned research into the 70m comments left on its site since 2006 and discovered that of the 10 most abused writers eight are women, and the two men are black. Hear from three of those writers, explore the data and help us host better conversations online Share on WhatsApp Comments allow readers to respond to an article instantly, asking questions, pointing out errors, giving new leads. At their best, comment threads are thoughtful, enlightening, funny: online communities where readers interact with journalists and others in ways that enrich the Guardian’s journalism. But at their worst, they are something else entirely. The Guardian was not the only news site to turn comments on, nor has it been the only one to find that some of what is written “below the line” is crude, bigoted or just vile. On all news sites where comments appear, too often things are said to journalists and other readers that would be unimaginable face to face – the Guardian is no exception. New research into our own comment threads provides the first quantitative evidence for what female journalists have long suspected: that articles written by women attract more abuse and dismissive trolling than those written by men, regardless of what the article is about. Although the majority of our regular opinion writers are white men, we found that those who experienced the highest levels of abuse and dismissive trolling were not. The 10 regular writers who got the most abuse were eight women (four white and four non-white) and two black men. Two of the women and one of the men were gay. And of the eight women in the “top 10”, one was Muslim and one Jewish. And the 10 regular writers who got the least abuse? All men. How should digital news organisations respond to this? Some say it is simple – “Don’t read the comments” or, better still, switch them off altogether. And many have done just that , disabling their comment threads for good because they became too taxing to bother with. But in so many cases journalism is enriched by responses from its readers. So why disable all comments when only a small minority is a problem? At the Guardian, we felt it was high time to examine the problem rather than turn away. We decided to treat the 70m comments that have been left on the Guardian – and in particular the comments that have been blocked by our moderators – as a huge data set to be explored rather than a problem to be brushed under the carpet. This is what we discovered. To date, 1.4 million comments (2% of the total) have been blocked by Guardian moderators because they violated the Guardian’s community standards . Most of these are abusive to some degree (they may use insulting language, or be ad hominem attacks) or are so off-topic that they derail the conversation. Full methodology [1 of 6] To see if men and women were treated differently by commenters, we began by classifying the authors of the articles by gender. While the number of articles published increased over time, the writers’ gender gap stayed pretty much the same, as it has in most media organisations . [2 of 6] This gender gap is bigger in some sections than others. Sport had the smallest proportion of articles written by women writers, but World News and Technology were not far behind. The only section that had significantly more articles written by women was Fashion. [3 of 6] Articles written by women got more blocked (ie abusive or disruptive) comments across almost all sections. But the more male-dominated the section, the more blocked comments the women who wrote there got (look at Sport and Technology). Fashion, where most articles were written by women, was one of the few sections where male authors consistently received more blocked comments. [4 of 6] Another way of looking at this, is that since around 2010 articles written by women consistently attracted a higher proportion of blocked comments than articles written by men. [5 of 6] Some sections attracted more blocked comments than others. World news, Opinion and Environment had more than the average number of abusive or disruptive comments. And so did Fashion. [6 of 6] We also found that some subjects attracted more abusive or disruptive comments than others. Conversations about crosswords, cricket, horse racing and jazz were respectful; discussions about the Israel/Palestine conflict were not. Articles about feminism attracted very high levels of blocked comments. And so did rape. We focused on gender in this research partly because we wanted to test the theory that women experience more abuse than men. But both writers and moderators observe that ethnic and religious minorities, and LGBT people also appear to experience a disproportionate amount of abuse. On the Guardian, commenters are asked to abide by our community standards , which aim to keep the conversation respectful and constructive – those that fall foul of those standards are blocked. The Guardian’s moderators don’t block comments simply because they don’t agree with them. The Guardian also blocks comments for legal reasons, but this makes up a very small proportion of blocked comments. Spam is not blocked (ie replaced by a standard moderator’s message) but deleted, and is not included in our findings; neither are replies to blocked comments, which are themselves automatically deleted. The vast majority of blocked comments, therefore, were blocked because they were considered abusive to some degree, or were otherwise disruptive to the conversation (they were off-topic, for example). For the purposes of this research, therefore, we used blocked comments as an indicator of abuse and disruptive behaviour. Even allowing for human error, the large number of comments in this data set gave us confidence in the results. But what do we mean by abuse and disruptive behaviour? At its most extreme, online abuse takes the form of threats to kill, rape or maim. Thankfully, such abuse was extremely rare on the Guardian – and when it did appear it was immediately blocked and the commenter banned. Less extreme “author abuse” – demeaning and insulting speech targeted at the writer of the article or another comment – is much more common on all online news sites, and it formed a significant proportion of the comments that were blocked on the Guardian site, too. Here are some examples: a female journalist reports on a demonstration outside an abortion clinic, and a reader responds, “You are so ugly that if you got pregnant I would drive you to the abortion clinic myself”; a British Muslim writes about her experiences of Islamophobia and is told to “marry an ISIS fighter and then see how you like that!”; a black correspondent is called “a racist who hates white people” when he reports the news that another black American has been shot by the police. We wouldn’t tolerate such insults offline, and at the Guardian we don’t tolerate it online either. The Guardian also blocked ad hominem attacks (on both readers and journalists): comments such as “You are so unintelligent”, “Call yourself a journalist?” or “Do you get paid for writing this?” are facile and add nothing of value to the debate. “Dismissive trolling” was blocked too – comments such as “Calm down, dear”, which mocked or otherwise dismissed the author or other readers rather than engaged with the piece itself. We know that abuse online isn’t always aimed at individuals. Hate speech as defined by law was rarely seen on Guardian comment threads (and when it did appear it was blocked and the commenter banned). But xenophobia, racism, sexism and homophobia were all seen regularly. Take for example, some of the comments left below an article on the mass drownings of migrant men, women and children in the Mediterranean: “These people contribute nothing to the countries they enter”; “The more corpses floating in the sea, the better”; “LET THEM ALL DROWN!” At the Guardian, comments like these are considered abusive and were blocked from appearing on the site. The Guardian also blocked comments that would otherwise disrupt or derail the debate: “ whataboutery ” of various kinds, or remarks that are clearly off-topic. While not abusive in themselves, such comments serve to make a constructive debate impossible, and show a lack of respect to the journalist and to other commenters in the thread. Sometimes moderation decisions are easy, other times it can be difficult to know where to draw the line. All are based on the Guardian’s community standards, not moderators’ personal tastes and opinions. quiz At the Guardian, readers and journalists can report abusive or off-topic comments, and moderators will quickly block them if they break the community standards. Moderation minimises the harm done by abuse that is posted on the site. But for journalists, abuse is rarely confined to the site on which their work appears, and on some sites and social media platforms it can be very hard to get abusive posts removed. So for them, the abuse they receive below the article they have written is not experienced in isolation: each snarky comment, each spiteful tweet, is ( as Zoe Quinn once put it ) just one snowflake in an avalanche. Related: How we analysed 70m comments on the Guardian website And avalanches happen easily online. Anonymity disinhibits people, making some of them more likely to be abusive. Mobs can form quickly: once one abusive comment is posted, others will often pile in, competing to see who can be the most cruel. This abuse can move across platforms at great speed – from Twitter, to Facebook, to blogposts – and it can be viewed on multiple devices – the desktop at work, the mobile phone at home. To the person targeted, it can feel like the perpetrator is everywhere: at home, in the office, on the bus, in the street. People who find themselves abused online are often told to ignore it – it’s only words; it isn’t real life. But in extreme cases, that distinction breaks down completely, such as when a person is doxed, or SWATed, when nude photos are posted of the person without consent, or when a stalker assumes the person’s identity on an online dating site and a string of all-too-real men appear at their door expecting sex. As one woman who had this experience said: “Virtual reality can become reality, and it ruins your life.” But in addition to the psychological and professional harm online abuse and harassment can cause to individuals, there are social harms, too. Recent research by the Pew Centre found that not only had 40% of adults experienced harassment online but 73% had witnessed others being harassed. This must surely have a chilling effect, silencing people who might otherwise contribute to public debates – particularly women, LGBT people and people from racial or religious minorities, who see others like themselves being racially and sexually abused. Is that the kind of culture we want to live in? Is that the web we want? Even five years ago, online abuse and harassment were dismissed as no big deal. That is not true now. There is widespread public concern, and more support for anti-harassment proposals. But no one is pretending that this is an easy problem to fix – not on the Guardian’s comment threads, where most commenters are respectful, and where there is already a high level of moderation, and certainly not elsewhere on the web as a whole, where there are sometimes no safeguards at all. The Guardian is committed to tackling the problem. This research is a part of that: an attempt to be open, and to share publicly what has been discovered. We hope to do more research to dig deeper into the problem, and to discover not only what can cause online conversations to go awry, but also what media organisations can do to help make those conversations better, and more inclusive. The Guardian has already taken the decision to cut down the number of places where comments are open on stories relating to a few particularly contentious subjects, such as migration and race. This allows moderators to keep a closer watch on conversations that we know are more likely to attract abuse. However, unlike many news sites, the Guardian has no plans to close comments altogether. For the most part, Guardian readers enrich the journalism. Only 2% of comments are blocked (a further 2% are deleted because they are spam or replies to blocked comments); the majority are respectful and many are wonderful. A good comment thread is a joy to read – and more common than the “don’t read the comments” detractors believe. As Prof Danielle Keats Citron argues in her book, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace , abusive behaviour is neither normal nor inevitable. Where it exists, it is a cultural problem that, collectively, we must try to solve using all the means at our disposal: technological and social. Which is where you come in. We want to hear from Guardian readers: when it comes to providing a space where everyone feels able to participate, what is the Guardian doing right, and how could we improve?

'Pinterest Jon Ronson confronts the people behind the Twitter account @jon_ronson Dan let out a long-suffering sigh. “You’re saying, ‘There is only one Jon Ronson’,” he said. “You’re proposing yourself as the real McCoy, as it were, and you want to maintain that integrity and authenticity. Yes?” I stared at him. “We’re not quite persuaded by that,” he continued. “We think there’s already a layer of artifice and it’s your online personality – the brand Jon Ronson – you’re trying to protect. Yeah?” “No, it’s just me tweeting,” I yelled. “The internet is not the real world,” said Dan. “I write my tweets,” I replied. “And I press send. So it’s me on Twitter.” We glared at each other. “That’s not academic,” I said. “That’s not postmodern. That’s the fact of it. It’s a misrepresentation of me.” “You’d like it to be more like you?” Dan said. “I’d like it to not exist,” I said. “I find that quite aggressive,” he said. “You’d like to kill these algorithms? You must feel threatened in some way.” He gave me a concerned look. “We don’t go around generally trying to kill things we find annoying.” “You’re a troll!” I yelled. I dreaded uploading the footage to YouTube , because I’d been so screechy. I steeled myself for mocking comments and posted it. I left it 10 minutes. Then, with apprehension, I had a look. “This is identity theft,” read the first comment I saw. “They should respect Jon’s personal liberty.” “Wow,” I thought, cautiously. “Somebody should make alternate Twitter accounts of all of those ass clowns and constantly post about their strong desire for child porn,” read the next comment. I grinned. “Utter hateful arseholes,” read the next comment. “These fucked-up academics deserve to die painfully. The cunt in the middle is a fucking psychopath.” I frowned slightly. “I hope nobody’s going to actually hurt them,” I thought. Within days, the academics took down @jon_ronson. They had been shamed into acquiescence. Their public shaming had been like the button that restores factory settings. It felt wonderful. The wonderful feeling overwhelmed me like a sedative. Strangers all over the world had united to tell me I was right. It was the perfect ending. *** In October 2012 a group of adults with learning difficulties took an organised trip to Washington DC. They visited the National Mall, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Smithsonian, Arlington National Cemetery, the US Mint. At night they sang karaoke in the hotel bar. Their caregivers, Lindsey Stone and her friend Jamie, did a duet of Total Eclipse Of The Heart. “They had the greatest time on that trip,” Lindsey told me. “They thought we were fun and cool.” Lindsey was telling me the story 18 months later. We were sitting at her kitchen table, in a seaside town on the US east coast. “I like to dance and I like to do karaoke,” Lindsey said, “but for a long time after that trip, I didn’t leave the house. During the day I’d just sit here. I didn’t want to be seen by anybody.” “How long did that last?” I asked. “Almost a year.” Lindsey and Jamie had been with Life (Living Independently Forever) for a year and a half before that trip. Life was a residence for “pretty high-functioning people with learning difficulties”, Lindsey said. “Jamie had started a jewellery club, which was a hit with the girls. We’d take them to the movies. We’d take them bowling. We heard a lot from parents that we were the best thing that ever happened to that campus.” Off-duty, she and Jamie had a running joke: taking stupid photographs, “smoking in front of a no-smoking sign or posing in front of statues, mimicking the pose. We took dumb pictures all the time. And so at Arlington [the national cemetery] we saw the Silence And Respect sign… and inspiration struck.” Lindsey posed in front of it, pretending she was shouting and swearing – flipping the bird, and with her hand to her open mouth. “So,” Lindsey said, “thinking we were funny, Jamie posted it on Facebook and tagged me on it with my consent, because I thought it was hilarious.” Lindsey Stone at Arlington Cemetery. Photograph: © Jamie Schuh Nothing much happened after that. A few Facebook friends posted unenthusiastic comments. “One had served in the military and he wrote a message saying, ‘This is kind of offensive. I know you girls, but it’s tasteless.’ Another said, ‘I agree’, and another said, ‘I agree’. Then I said, ‘Whoa! It’s just us being douchebags! Forget about it!’” After that, Jamie said to Lindsey, “Do you think we should take it down?” “No!” Lindsey replied, “What’s the big deal? No one’s ever going to think of it again.” Their Facebook settings were a mystery to them. Most of the privacy boxes were ticked. Some weren’t. Sometimes they’d half-notice that boxes they’d thought they’d ticked weren’t ticked. Lindsey has been thinking about that “a lot” these past 18 months. “Facebook works best when everyone is sharing and liking. It brings their ad revenues up.” Was there some Facebook shenanigan where things just “happen” to untick themselves? Some loophole? “I don’t want to sound like a conspiracy theorist. I don’t know if Jamie’s mobile uploads had ever been private.” Whatever: Jamie’s mobile uploads weren’t private. And four weeks after returning from Washington DC, they were in a restaurant, celebrating their birthdays – “We’re a week apart” – when they became aware that their phones were vibrating repeatedly. So they went online. “Lindsey Stone hates the military and hates soldiers who have died in foreign wars”, “You should rot in hell”, “Just pure Evil”, “Spoke with an employee from Life who has told me there are veterans on the board and that she will be fired. Awaiting info on her accomplice”, “After they fire her, maybe she needs to sign up as a client. Woman needs help”, “Send the dumb feminist to prison”. There were death and rape threats. “I wanted to scream: ‘It was just about a sign,’” Lindsey said. By the time she went to bed that night, at 4am, a Fire Lindsey Stone Facebook page had been created. It attracted 12,000 likes. Lindsey read every comment. “I really became obsessed with reading everything about myself.” The next day, camera crews had gathered outside her front door. Her father tried talking to them. He had a cigarette in his hand. The family dog had followed him out. As he tried to explain that Lindsey wasn’t a terrible person, he noticed the cameras move from his face down to the cigarette and the dog, as if they were a family of hillbillies. Life was inundated with emails demanding their jobs, so Lindsey was called into work. But she wasn’t allowed inside the building. Her boss met her in the car park and told her to hand over her keys. “Literally overnight, everything I knew and loved was gone,” Lindsey said. And that’s when she fell into a depression, became an insomniac, and barely left home for a year. That year, Lindsey scanned Craigslist for carer work, but nobody replied to her applications. She was eventually offered a job caring for children with autism. “But I’m terrified,” she said. “That your bosses will find out?’ “Yeah.” This was a likely scenario. The photograph was everywhere. It had become so iconic among swaths of rightwingers that one man had even turned it into patriotic wallpaper, superimposing on to the wall behind Lindsey’s shrieking face and upturned finger a picture of a military funeral, complete with a coffin draped in the American flag. Lindsey had wanted the job so much she’d been “nervous about even applying. I was conflicted on whether to say to them, ‘Just so you know, I am this Lindsey Stone.’ Because I knew it was just a mouse click away.” She left it until the moment of the interview. And then the interview was over and she found that she hadn’t mentioned it. Now she’d been in the job four months, and she still hadn’t told them. “And obviously, you can’t ask them, ‘Have you noticed it and decided it’s not a problem?’” I said. “Right,” Lindsey said. “So you feel trapped in a paranoid silence?” I said. “I love this job so much,” Lindsey said. “I love these kids. One of the parents paid me a really high compliment the other day. I’ve only been working with her son for a month and she was like, ‘The moment I met you, seeing the way you are with my son, and the way you treat people, you were meant to work in this field.’ But what if she found out? Would she feel the same way?” Lindsey could never just be happy and relaxed. The terror was always there. “It really impacts the way you view the world. Since it happened, I haven’t tried to date anybody. How much do you let a new person into your life? Do they already know?” *** The Village Pub in Woodside, near Menlo Park, Silicon Valley, looks like no big deal from the outside, but when you get inside, you realise it’s filled with tech billionaires. I had recently discovered the world of digital reputation management – companies that “game” Google to hide negative stories stored online. One of these companies is reputation.com , launched by my dining companion, Michael Fertik. I told Michael that he was the only person from that world who had returned my email. “That’s because this is a really easy sector in which to be an unappealing, scurrilous operation,” he said. “Scurrilous in what way?” “There’s a guy who has some traction in our space, who runs a company – he’s a convicted rapist,” Michael said. “He started a company to basically obscure that fact about himself, I think.” Michael’s competitors were disreputable, he said, and he needed to be vigilant with potential clients. “Very early on, within two weeks of launching our website in 2006, I remember being by myself and getting a couple of sign-ups from guys. So I Googled them. They were paedophiles.” “Do you remember their names?” I asked. “Of course not,” Michael said. “Why do you ask that shit?” “I don’t know,” I said. “Curiosity.” Michael looked different from our fellow diners. I didn’t recognise any of them, but everyone seemed insanely rich: preppy, with faces like luxury yachts, like Martha’s Vineyard in the summer, Waspy and at peace with the world, practically floating through the restaurant, whereas Michael was a big, angry, coiled-spring Jewish bear of a man. He was born in New York, attained a degree from Harvard Law School, and invented the concept of online reputation management while working as a clerk for the US Court of Appeals in Louisville, Kentucky. This was the mid-2000s. Stories about cyberbullying and revenge porn were just starting to filter though, and that’s how Michael got the idea. After he turned down the paedophiles, Michael told me, he noticed he was getting sign-ups from neo-Nazis, albeit repentant former ones. One said: “When I was 17, I was a Nazi. I was an asshole kid. Now I’m in my 40s, I’m trying to move on, but the internet still thinks I am a Nazi.” They were more sympathetic than the paedophiles, but Michael still didn’t want them as clients. So he drew up a code of conduct: he wouldn’t accept anyone who was under investigation or had been convicted of a felony violent crime, or a felony fraud crime, or any sexually violent crime, or anyone accused – even informally – of a sexual crime against children. And, he said, there was another moral difference between him and his competitors: he wouldn’t invent fake accolades; he’d only put the truth up there. Although, “I don’t think it’s incumbent on anyone to do massive fact-checking.” “I have no idea what you actually do,” I had told Michael on the telephone before we met. “Maybe I could follow someone though the process?” And so we planned it out. We’d just need to find a willing client. *** “Are there any hobbies you’re particularly passionate about right now? Marathons? Photography?” Farukh Rashid was in San Francisco, talking down a conference line to Lindsey Stone. I was listening in from my sofa in New York. I’d met Farukh a few months earlier, when Michael’s publicist, Leslie, gave me a tour of the reputation.com offices: two open-plan floors with soundproofed booths for the sensitive calls to celebrity clients. She introduced me to Farukh and explained that he usually works on Michael’s VIP customers – the CEOs and celebrities. “It’s nice that you’re giving Lindsey the bespoke service,” I said. “She needs it,” Leslie replied. She really did. Michael’s strategists had been researching Lindsey’s online life and had discovered nothing about her besides that Silence And Respect incident. Michael got sign-ups from people saying, ‘At 17 I was a Nazi. The internet still thinks I’m a Nazi’ “That five seconds of her life is her entire internet presence?” I said. Farukh nodded. “And it’s not just this Lindsey Stone. Anyone who has that name has the same problem. There are 60 Lindsey Stones in the US and they’re all being defined by that one photograph.” “I’m sorry to have given you such a tricky one,” I said, feeling a little proud of myself. “Oh, no, we’re excited,” Farukh replied. “We’re going to introduce the internet to the real Lindsey Stone.” “Are cats important to you?” Farukh asked Lindsey, now down the conference line. “Absolutely,” said Lindsey. I heard Farukh type. He was young and energetic, and just as upbeat and buoyant and lacking in cynicism and malevolent irony as he was hoping to make Lindsey seem. His Twitter profile says he enjoys “biking, hiking and family time”. His plan was to create Lindsey Stone Tumblrs and LinkedIn pages and WordPress blogs and Instagram accounts and YouTube accounts to overwhelm that terrible photograph, wash it away in a tidal wave of positivity, away to a place on Google where normal people don’t look – a place like page two of the search results. According to Google’s own research, 53% of us don’t go beyond the first two search results, and 89% of us don’t look past the first page. “I’m passionate about music,” Lindsey told Farukh. “That’s really good,” Farukh said. “Let’s work with that. Do you play an instrument?” “I used to,” Lindsey said. “I was kind of self-taught. It’s just something I mess around with. It’s not anything I…” Suddenly, she trailed off. she seemed self-conscious, as if the endeavour was giving her troubling existential thoughts: questions such as “Who am I?” and “What are we doing?” “I’m having a hard time with this,” she said. “As a normal person I don’t really know how to brand myself online.” “Piano? Guitar? Drums?” said Farukh. “Or travel? Where do you go?” “I don’t know,” Lindsey said. “I go to the beach. I get ice-cream.” At Farukh’s request, Lindsey had been emailing him photographs that didn’t involve her flipping off at military cemeteries. She’d been providing biographical details, too. Her favourite TV show was Parks And Recreation. Her employment history included five years at Walmart, “which was kind of soul-suckingly awful”. “Are you sure you want to say that Walmart was soul-sucking?” Farukh said. “Oh… What? Really?” Lindsey laughed, as if to say, “Come on! Everyone knows that about Walmart!” But then she hesitated. The conference call was proving an unexpectedly melancholic experience. It was nothing to do with Farukh. He really felt for Lindsey and wanted to do a good job for her. The sad thing was that Lindsey had incurred the internet’s wrath because she was impudent and playful and foolhardy and outspoken. And now here she was, working with Farukh to reduce herself to safe banalities – to cats and ice-cream and top 40 chart music. We were creating a world where the smartest way to survive is to be bland. There was a time when Michael Fertik wouldn’t have needed to be so calculating. Back in the mid-90s, search engines were interested only in how many times a particular keyword appeared within a page. To be the number-one Jon Ronson search term on AltaVista or HotBot, you just had to write Jon Ronson over and over again. Which, for me, would be the most fantastic website to chance upon, but for everyone else, less so. But then two students at Stanford, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had an idea: why not build a search engine that ranked websites by popularity instead? If someone is linking to your page, that’s one vote. If the page linking to your page has a lot of links into it, then that page counts for more votes. And that was it. They called their invention PageRank, after Larry Page. This was why Farukh needed to create LinkedIn and Tumblr and Twitter pages for Lindsey. They come with a built-in high PageRank. The Google algorithm prejudges them as well-liked. But, for Michael, the problem with Google is that it is forever adjusting its algorithm in ways it keeps secret. “Google is a tricky beast and a moving target,” he told me, “so we try to decipher it, to reverse-engineer it.” Lindsey incurred the internet’s wrath because she was outspoken. Now she was reducing herself to cats and chart music Knowing what he did about PageRank’s algorithm, Michael predicted that Lindsey’s love of cats (or whatever) would achieve “initial strong impact”, followed by “fluctuation”, and, after fluctuation, “reversion”. Michael’s clients dread reversion. There’s nothing more dispiriting than seeing the nice new judgments disappear and the horrific old judgments bubble back up. But reversion is actually their friend, as Michael’s strategist, Jered Higgins, told me. “Reversion shows that the algorithm is uncertain,” he said. And during this uncertainty, Jered said, “We go in and blast it.” The blasting – the bombardment of the algorithm with Tumblr pages about Lindsey’s trips to the beach, the shock and awe of these pleasant banalities – has to be choreographed just right. Google knows if it’s being manipulated (alarm bells go off) “so we have a strategic schedule for content creation and publication,” Jered said. “We create a natural-looking activity online. That’s a lot of accumulated intelligence.” *** “I am a nobody,” Hank said. “Just a guy with a family and a job – a middle-America-type guy.” Hank wasn’t his real name. He’d managed to keep that aspect of himself a secret. He was talking to me via a Google Hangout from his kitchen in a suburban house in an American town. He looked frail, fidgety. On 17 March 2013, Hank was in the audience at a conference for tech developers in Santa Clara, California, when a stupid joke popped into his head, which he murmured to his friend, Alex. “What was the joke?” I asked. “It was so bad I don’t remember the exact words,” he said. “It was about a fictitious piece of hardware that has a really big dongle – a ridiculous dongle. We were giggling about that. It wasn’t even conversation-level volume.” A few moments earlier, Hank and Alex had been giggling over some other tech in-joke about “forking someone’s repo”. “We’d decided it was a new form of flattery,” Hank explained. “A guy had been on stage presenting his new project, and Alex said, ‘I would fork that guy’s repo.’” (In tech jargon, to “fork” means to take a copy of another person’s software so you can work on it independently. Another word for software is “repository”. Just in case you wanted to know.) Moments after making the dongle joke, Hank half-noticed the woman sitting in front of them stand up, turn around and take a photograph. Ten minutes later, a conference organiser came down the aisle and said to Hank and Alex, “Can you come with me?” They were taken into an office and told there’d been a complaint about sexual comments. “I immediately apologised,” Hank said. “I knew exactly what they were talking about. I told them what we’d said, and that we didn’t mean for it to come across as a sexual comment, and that we were sorry if someone overheard and was offended. They were like, ‘OK. I see what happened.’” And that was that. The incident passed. Hank and Alex were shaken up – “We’re nerdy guys, and confrontation isn’t something we handle well” – so they decided to leave the conference early. They were on their way to the airport when they started to wonder exactly how someone had conveyed the complaint to the conference organisers. The nightmarish possibility was that it had been communicated in the form of a public tweet. And so, with apprehension, they had a look. They found a tweet from a woman, called Adria Richards, with a photo of them: “Not cool. Jokes about forking repo’s in a sexual way and ‘big’ dongles. Right behind me #pycon”. Anxious, Hank quickly scanned her replies, but there was nothing much – just the odd congratulation from a few of her 9,209 followers for the way she’d “educated” the men behind her. He noticed ruefully that a few days earlier Adria Richards had herself tweeted a stupid penis joke. She’d suggested to a friend that he should put socks down his pants to bewilder security agents at the airport. Hank relaxed a little. A day later, Hank was called into his boss’s office and fired. “I packed up all my stuff in a box,” Hank said, “then I went outside to call my wife. I’m not one to shed tears but…” Hank paused. “When I got in the car with my wife, I just… I’ve got three kids. Getting fired was terrifying.” — Adria Richards (@adriarichards) March 17, 2013 Not cool. Jokes about forking repo’s in a sexual way and "big" dongles. Right behind me #pycon pic.twitter.com/Hv1bkeOsYP That night, Hank made his only public statement. He posted a short message on the discussion board Hacker News: “Hi, I’m the guy who made a comment about big dongles. First of all I’d like to say I’m sorry. I really did not mean to offend anyone and I really do regret the comment and how it made Adria feel. She had every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position. [But] as a result of the picture she took I was let go from my job today. Which sucks because I have three kids and I really liked that job. She gave me no warning, she smiled while she snapped the pic and sealed my fate.” *** Ten months later, I was sitting opposite Adria Richards in a cafe at San Francisco airport. She seemed introverted and delicate, just the way Hank had come across over Google Hangout. She told me about the moment she overheard the comment about the big dongle. “Have you ever had an altercation at school and you could feel the hairs rise up on your back?” she asked me. “You felt fear?” I asked. “Danger,” she said. “Clearly my body was telling me, ‘You are unsafe.’” Which was why, she said, even though she’d never before complained about sexual harassment, she “slowly stood up, rotated from my hips, and took three photos”. She tweeted one, “with a very brief summary of what they said. Then I sent another tweet describing my location. Right? And then the third tweet was the [conference’s] code of conduct.” “You talked about danger,” I said. “What were you imagining might…?” “Have you ever heard that thing, men are afraid that women will laugh at them and women are afraid that men will kill them?” she replied. “So. Yeah.” ’He’s a white male,’ Adria said. ’I’m a black Jewish female. He said things that could be inferred as offensive to me’ I told Adria that people might consider that an overblown thing to say. She had, after all, been at a tech conference with 2,000 bystanders. “Sure,” she replied. “And those people would probably be white and they would probably be male.” “Somebody getting fired is pretty bad,” I said. “I know you didn’t call for him to be fired, but you must have felt pretty bad.” “Not too bad,” she said. She thought more and shook her head decisively. “He’s a white male. I’m a black Jewish female. He was saying things that could be inferred as offensive to me, sitting in front of him. I do have empathy for him, but it only goes so far. If he had Down’s syndrome and he accidently pushed someone off a subway, that would be different… I’ve seen things where people are like, ‘Adria didn’t know what she was doing by tweeting it.’ Yes, I did.” On the evening Hank posted his statement on Hacker News, outsiders began to involve themselves in his and Adria’s story. Hank started to receive messages of support, and then insults, from men’s rights bloggers. He didn’t respond to any of them. At the same time, Adria discovered she was getting discussed on a famous meeting place for trolls: 4chan/b/. “A father of three is out of a job because a silly joke he was telling a friend was overheard by someone with more power than sense. Let’s crucify this cunt.” “Kill her.” “Cut out her uterus with an xacto knife.” Someone sent Adria a photograph of a beheaded woman with tape over her mouth. Adria’s face was superimposed on to the bodies of porn actors. Next, her employer’s website went down. Someone launched a DDoS attack, which overwhelms a site’s servers with repeated requests. SendGrid, her employer, was told the attacks would stop if she was fired. Within hours, she was fired. ‘‘SendGrid threw me under the bus,” she later emailed me. “I felt betrayed. I felt abandoned. I felt ashamed. I felt rejected. I felt alone.’’ The death threats and rape threats and racist insults continued even after she was fired. “Things got very bad for her,” Hank told me. “She had to disappear for six months. Her entire life was being evaluated by the internet. It was not a good situation for her at all.” “Have you met her since?” I asked him. “No,” he replied. Ten months had passed since the day Adria took that photograph, so I asked what he thought of her now. “I think that nobody deserves what she went through,” he replied. “Maybe it was [Hank] who started all of this,” Adria told me in the cafe at San Francisco airport. “No one would have known he got fired until he complained... Maybe he’s to blame for complaining that he got fired. Maybe he secretly seeded the hate groups. Right?” I was so taken aback by this suggestion that at the time I didn’t say anything in defence of Hank. But later I felt bad that I hadn’t stuck up for him. So I emailed Adria. I told her what he had told me – how he’d refused to engage with any of the bloggers or trolls who sent him messages of support. I added that I felt Hank was within his rights to post the message on Hacker News, revealing he’d been fired. Adria replied that she was happy to hear that Hank “wasn’t active in driving their interests to mount the raid attack”, but that she held him responsible for it anyway. It was “his own actions that resulted in his own firing, yet he framed it in a way to blame me… If I had a spouse and two kids to support, I certainly would not be telling ‘jokes’ like he was doing at a conference. Oh, but wait, I have compassion, empathy, morals and ethics to guide my daily life choices. I often wonder how people like Hank make it through life seemingly unaware of how ‘the other’ lives in the same world he does, but with countless fewer opportunities.” I asked Hank if he found himself behaving differently since the incident. Had it altered how he lived his life? “I distance myself from female developers a little bit now,” he replied. “I’m not as friendly. There’s humour, but it’s very mundane. You just don’t know. I can’t afford another Donglegate.” “Give me an example,” I said. “So you’re in your new workplace [Hank was offered another job right away] and you’re talking to a female developer. In what way do you act differently towards her?’ “Well,” Hank said, “we don’t have any female developers at the place I’m working at now. So.” “You’ve got a new job now, right?” I said to Adria. “No,” she said. Later, I saw another photograph Adria happened to take that day at the conference. It was an audience shot. A sea of men – practically only men – stretching to the horizon. *** In October 2014, I took a final drive to visit Lindsey Stone. Four months had passed since I’d last spoken to her or Farukh – and given that they’d only taken her on for my benefit, I’d half-wondered if maybe it had all been quietly wound down in my absence. “Oh God, no,” said Lindsey. We sat at her kitchen table. “They call me every week, week after week.” She took out her phone and scrolled through her innumerable emails from Farukh. She read out loud some blogs his team had written in her voice, about how it’s important when travelling to use the hotel safe – “Stay alert, travellers!” – and how, if you’re in Spain, you should try the tapas. Lindsey got to pre-approve everything, and she’d only told them no twice, she said – to a blog about how much she’s looking forward to Lady Gaga’s upcoming jazz album (“I like Lady Gaga, but I’m not really excited about her jazz album”) and to her tribute to Disneyland on the occasion of its 50th birthday: “Happy Birthday Disneyland! The Happiest Place on Earth!” “Happy Birthday Disneyland!” Lindsey blushed. “I would never… I mean, I had a great time at Disneyland. But still…” She trailed off. “One of my friends from high school said, ‘I hope it’s still you. I want people to know how funny you are.’ But it’s scary. After all that’s happened, what’s funny to me… I don’t want to go anywhere near the line, let alone cross it. So I’m constantly saying, ‘I don’t know, Farukh, what do you think?’” “This journey started with my identity being hijacked by a spambot,” I said. “Your personality has been taken by strangers twice now. But at least this second time around it’s nice.” Lindsey hadn’t Googled herself for 11 months. Ex-army people were wondering where she was – ‘not in a good way’ Lindsey hadn’t typed her name into Google for 11 months. The last time had been a shock: it was Veterans’ Day, and she found some ex-army people “wondering where I was, and not in a good way”. “They were thinking about tracking you down so they could re-destroy you?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. She hadn’t looked since. And now she swallowed and began to type: L… I… N… Lindsey shook her head, stunned. “This is monumental,” she said. Two years ago, the photograph stretched to Google Images horizon – uninterrupted, mass-production shaming, “pages and pages and pages”, Lindsey said, “repeating endlessly. It felt so huge. So oppressive.” And now: nearly gone. There was still a scattering, and there would inevitably be some reversion, but for now there were lots of photographs of Lindsey doing nothing bad. Just smiling. Even better, there were lots of photographs of other Lindsey Stones – people who weren’t her at all. There was a Lindsey Stone volleyball player, a Lindsay Stone competitive swimmer. The swimmer had been captured mid-stroke, moments from winning the New York State 500-yard freestyle championship. It was captioned, “Lindsay Stone had the right plan in place and everything was going exactly to plan.” Here was a whole other person, doing something everyone could agree was lovely and commendable. There was no better result than that. This is an edited extract from So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed, by Jon Ronson, published next month by Picador at £16.99.

'Share on WhatsApp Stretched out on a table in a large, bright operating theatre at the Royal London hospital, a patient is awaiting Shafi Ahmed’s first incision in a procedure that will remove cancerous tissue from his bowel. Around the table a team dressed in blue scrubs and face masks are gathered, exchanging the odd word, while cumbersome machines bearing bundles of wires hum gently in the background. Everyone is focused on the task in hand, getting ready to play their part. Except me. Scrubless and without so much as a scalpel to pass to the surgeon, I am a mere spectator to this intricate event, a bystander gazing around the room in fascination while others labour at a life-changing task. Not that the surgeons are bothered. Because although I feel like I am standing at the edge of the operating table, in reality I am sitting in my office chair. Related: UK cancer surgery to be live-streamed via virtual reality technology On Thursday afternoon I witnessed the world’s first operation to be streamed live in 360-degree video, allowing medical students, trainee surgeons and curious members of the public like me to immerse themselves in the procedure in real time via the Medical Realities website . A one-minute delay was incorporated into the broadcast in case of any complications in the surgery. A cancer surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust, Ahmed said before the operation that he believed the approach could make healthcare more equitable, improving the training of surgeons worldwide. With internet connections becoming better, smartphones getting cheaper and only a pair of lenses and some cardboard needed to make a virtual reality headset, the costs, he said, paled in comparison to the expense of students travelling abroad to train. “It is actually quite cost-effective.” Shot using two 360-degree cameras and a number of lenses arranged around the theatre, the operation could be viewed through the “VR in OR” app , using a virtual reality headset that can be paired with a smartphone. Those who did not have a headset could watch the feed live online . It takes a while to get the app up and running so while I wait for the VR experience to start I watch the procedure begin via the website. The lights are dimmed and, wielding an intimidating device, Ahmed begins to remove a hernia. “This is called a harmonic scalpel,” he says as he gets to work. A hush descends, punctured only by beeping. Peering down I spot some odd-looking scissors I hope no one will ever use on me. Two large screens on either side of the table show views from the camera inside the patient – a device that resembles an enormous knitting needle. The team prepares to tackle the cancer. “OK let’s have a look, here we go,” says Ahmed. Fortunately the app boots up. And I am in the room too. “There is a tumour just here,” says Ahmed. “This is what cancer looks like in reality.” While videos showcasing surgical procedures have been around for years, Ahmed believes the new approach is more than a mere gimmick. The technology, he has argued, brings a valuable new feature to education, allowing viewers to focus not just on what the surgeon is doing, but also on what other members of the team are up to: “There will be noise, there will be the immersive factor – so that will add different layers of educational value.” George Hanna , professor of surgical sciences at Imperial College, London was cautiously optimistic about the benefits of the approach. “If this technology allows the transfer of knowledge and skills [over] a wider range and in an easier way that would be very beneficial,” he said. But he was quick to add that, compared with existing approaches for sharing scenes from the operating theatre, the new technology offered more of an upgrade than a revolution. “It is a good video and wide broadcast with interactive [opportunities],” he said, stressing that the operation itself was real rather than virtual. Related: Long-term effects of virtual reality use need more research, say scientists Back in the virtual world, there is a slight hitch – the quality of the video on my phone is good, but not good enough to see the video screen clearly. It looks like they are fishing about in a swamp of slimy undercooked sausages: I suspect a medical student would glean rather more. Frustratingly, 360-degree video is just that – you can look around the room in every direction, but you can’t move for a better view. The procedure continues. Despite my loathing of all medical TV dramas, I am hooked. Suddenly the entire theatre goes dark, except for a spotlight. Someone is making an incision. They pull out a pink, fleshy mass. “Scissors,” says someone. A bundle that I assume is the tumour is removed and dropped into a bowl. The operation has been a success. It was not the first time Ahmed had led the way in embracing modern technology in healthcare. He co-founded the healthcare company Medical Realities, which streamed the operation in partnership with Barts Health and 360-degree video experts Mativision . Ahmed said he believes virtual reality, augmented reality and games could all play a role in training medical students. Two years ago he streamed a live operation using the “augmented reality” system, Google Glass , allowing viewers to see the procedure from a surgeon’s point of view. But the new 360-degree video, Ahmed said, offered a new approach, allowing users to see beyond what the surgeon was looking at. Among future developments he has envisaged, Ahmed said he was keen to add graphics to the raw footage to provide additional information during the operation, as well as taking questions from those viewing the procedure. “[During an operation] I am teaching people, talking to them, there is communication going on – so it’ll be just an extension of that,” he said. In three to five years, haptic devices – which work off physical contact between the user and computer – could boost the experience further: “Companies are really working on various gloves or bodysuits and devices so that it can replicate touch and feel.” Such technologies, said Ahmed, could be a boon to healthcare. But, he added, the role of patients in agreeing to take part should not be forgotten. “Ultimately, it is about the operation, about [the patient], about his cancer care and that has to be the priority for everybody. “The fact that patients have agreed to do this before – with the Google Glass – and again, it is quite reassuring and quite humbling.” ',?
'Best iPhone and iPad apps Five of the best face swap apps MSQRD, Face Swap Live, Snapchat and other apps fuelling the latest social craze – including one invented by Yahoo back in 2013 Facebook liked face-swapping app MSQRD so much, it bought the company. Thursday 17 March 2016 05.42 EDT Last modified on Thursday 17 March 2016 08.28 EDT Will 2016 go down in history as the year we failed to heed the warning about artificial intelligence overthrowing humanity one stone at a time , because we were distracted by swapping faces with our friends , our pets or nearby breasts ? Perhaps. Face-swapping apps aren’t actually new – several have been around since 2013 – but they have become this year’s mobile craze, in a lineage that includes Draw Something, Dubsmash, Flappy Bird, FatBooth and (in the earliest days of Apple’s App Store) virtual pint-drinking and lightsaber apps. The craze may only last as long as it takes for the next novelty app genre to emerge, but in the meantime, here are five apps for giving face-swapping a go. MSQRD Pinterest MSQRD. App crazes may come and go, but tech startups shunning vowels is a trend that will never die. MSQRD (i.e. Masquerade) made headlines this month when it was acquired by Facebook less than three months after launching. For now, the app remains available on Android and iOS. MSQRD is pitched as a “video selfies” app for recording short clips of your digitally edited face – from adding virtual accessories through to celebrity face-masks, as well as swapping faces with friends. It’s easy to use, as you swipe between effects, with quick sharing to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Face Swap Live Pinterest Face Swap Live.

For now, Face Swap Live is iOS-only, although its developer is getting Android users to sign up to be notified when it gets ported to Google-powered smartphones. Live face swaps with friends (or body parts) are its key appeal, although Face Swap Live also works with photos, including pics of celebrities pulled from the web. The celebrity angle is fuelling the face-swap buzz: mapping your face on to Donald Trump’s infamous hairline is the new political satire. Possibly. Snapchat ',?
