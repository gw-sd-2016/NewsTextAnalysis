'European parliament approves tougher data privacy rules ‘Groundbreaking’ changes strengthen EU privacy protections, enshrine right to be forgotten and give regulators wide-reaching powers Former vice-president of the European commission Viviane Reding hailed the move as a ‘historic day for Europe’. Photograph: Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images Thursday 14 April 2016 08.22 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 08.23 EDT Share on WhatsApp The European parliament has voted through tougher rules on data protection, aimed at boosting privacy and giving authorities greater powers to take action against companies that breach the rules. The rules, including the much-needed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), were four years in the making and form the new backbone of laws for data regulators to pursue companies with heavy fines – as much as 4% of annual turnover for global companies – for incidents such as data breaches, which have become increasingly common. Viviane Reding, MEP and former vice-president of the European commission who proposed the changes in 2012, said: “This is a historic day for Europe. This reform will restore trust in digital services today, thereby reigniting the engine for growth tomorrow. “There can be no freedom without security, and no security without freedom. Today’s concomitant adoption of these three legislations sends a strong signal that national security and data protection can and must go hand in hand.” Replacing the patchwork of national rules The new data privacy laws comprise of the GDPR, which governs the use and privacy of EU citizens’ data, and the Data Protection Directive, which governs the use of EU citizens’ data by law enforcement. Together they aim to create strong data protection law for Europe’s 500 million citizens; streamline legislation between the 28 member states pushing a digital single market and boost police and security cooperation. It is due to replace the outdated patchwork of national rules that have only allowed for small fines in cases of violation. Phil Lee, a data protection partner at Fieldfisher, said: “Is this law ground-breaking? Absolutely. Europe has created the notions of a ‘right to be forgotten’ and of ‘data portability’, and created fines for data breaches that are on a scale equivalent to fines for antitrust violations. No other region has done that before. “Whatever else may be said about it, the simple fact is that the global standard for data protection will now be dictated by European rules.” The new laws have already proved controversial with companies wishing to operate with EU citizens’ data, placing an administrative burden on some, including those based outside of Europe. William Long, a partner at Sidley Austin, said: “Organisations should be under no doubt that now is the time to start the process for ensuring privacy compliance with the regulations. Importantly, companies outside of Europe, such as those in the US who offer goods and services to Europeans, will fall under the scope of this legislation and will face the same penalties for non-compliance.” ePrivacy Directive next The next step in strengthening of data regulation across the EU is an overhaul of the ePrivacy Directive, which will now commence in earnest, to bring it inline with the changes laid out in the GDPR. The European parliament also voted through the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR), which aims to aid law enforcement in tracking people’s movement across Europe. EC’s first vice-president Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip, and commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Věra Jourová, said: “These new rules come at a time when improved cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime is more necessary than ever, as shown by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels.” Reding added: “Faced with the transnational nature of the digital revolution and the fight against terror, EU-wide rules are the only solution to our problems. “PNR is an important tool to track terrorists flying in and out of Europe in a much wider toolkit, which should also include the systematic sharing of information in all EU databases.” ',?
'Pinterest Protesters clang pots and pangs at the fundraisers. Photograph: The Guardian “They sell you a dream at startups – the ping-pong, the perks – so they can pull 80 hours out of you,” said Quirk, a 26-year-old software engineer. “But in reality the venture capitalists control all the capital, all the labor, and all the decisions, so yeah, it feels great protesting one.” Nearly 200 Bernie Sanders supporters gathered last night with pots and pans outside Shervin Pishevar’s star-studded Clinton fundraiser, co-hosted by George and Amal Clooney. The Sanders supporters argued corporate interests were buying Clinton that night – tickets for Pishevar’s dinner started at $33,400 (for a seat at the Fairmont hotel) and went up to $353,400 (for a seat at his house). Most of those in the streets were young, and many were in tech. “Tech workers are workers, no matter how much money they make. The investors are what’s wrong in this city,” said 24-year-old Tom Sliwowski, one of the Bay Area Movement For Bernie organizers and a PhD student at Berkeley. “Tech workers are the face of gentrification, but they’re not the cause. “Also, let’s be honest, you can’t blame them for ruining the Mission when Palo Alto is so boring.” Massive protests outside Democratic fundraisers are rare in San Francisco , where most popular ire is directed at conservative events at South Bay estates. No major rallies rocked Nob Hill when Pishevar hosted Barack Obama for a fundraiser during his re-election campaign. Related: Millennials ’heart’ Bernie Sanders: why the young and hip are #FeelingtheBern But today there’s a growing rift in the city, which may influence the 7 June Democratic primary. Among the tech community, as wealth consolidates, many young workers lured to town with images of striking it rich have been confronted by an increasingly depressing startup environment. Bill Sandberg, a 29-year-old protester, said he had just been laid off from Zedo, an ad tech startup: “Bernie’s actually for the people. Hillary’s just bought and sold.” Sanders has won over at least this set of tech workers. He’s raised $3.2m to Clinton’s $1.5m in the tech sector since February, according to the independent election data site CrowdPac . Around the state, Clinton’s still holds a lead, but Sanders is gaining. He has 39.3% of the vote to Clinton’s 48.8%, according to poll averages . The Sanders campaign used outrage over Pishevar’s event to push for fundraising last night, asking for “small-dollar” donations that would match the price tag of a seat at the fundraiser. “Now, you know where this campaign stands on George Clooney. YUGE fans,” campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote supporters. “But a political contribution of $353,000?!??! That’s just an obscene amount of money.” ',?
'Movies AMC abandons plan for texting-friendly theaters after wave of backlash Two days after head of AMC Theatres mulled openly about allowing texting in movie theaters, he says he’s heard audience opinion ‘loud and clear’ Peace has been restored to the movie-going galaxy. Photograph: Jani Bryson/Getty Images Associated Press in Los Angeles Friday 15 April 2016 16.38 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 17.42 EDT Share on WhatsApp Oops. The idea lasted about as long as a Snapchat text: the head of AMC Theatres mulled openly about creating texting-friendly movie theaters to appeal to smartphone-addicted youngsters. Two days later, after a backlash on social media, the company says it’s leaving the idea on “the cutting room floor”. Adam Aron, who became CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings in December, told Variety magazine for a story Wednesday that the company would consider allowing cellphone use in some theaters to appeal to millennials. Related: Texting in movie theaters? Bring it on | Amber Jamieson “When you tell a 22-year-old to ‘Turn off the phone, don’t ruin the movie,’ they hear ‘Please cut off your left arm above the elbow.’ You can’t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That’s not how they live their life,” he said. That’s when the Twitter-verse unleashed a torrent of criticism on the plan. “AMC Theaters want to allow texting in movie theaters. In other news, I’ll never go to AMC Theaters ever again,” tweeted Fox News reporter Jake Hamilton. Blogger Perez Hilton tweeted the plan made sense “because everything is the worst”. Lucasfilm story executive Pablo Hidalgo mulled a day when he “brings enormous durian fruit to AMC theater; live-tweets and periscopes self eating it while movie plays”. Before the spasmic social media outrage continued much longer, AMC released a statement from Aron early Friday saying he had “instantaneously” reversed his thinking. “With your advice in hand, there will be NO TEXTING ALLOWED in any of the auditoriums at AMC Theatres. Not today, not tomorrow and not for the foreseeable future,” he said. “Unlike the many AMC advancements that you have applauded, we have heard loud and clear that this is a concept our audience does not want.” Peace was restored to the movie-going galaxy. “I love when rational thought wins out,” tweeted Holly Overton. “Thanks (at)amctheaters for respecting moviegoers!” “[Y]ay! Amc is literally the only theater chain in my area, so I’m relieved,” tweeted Benjy Monteagudo. And some had moved on to the next issue: the lengthy ads before a movie plays. “OK guys we did it,” tweeted Brian Collins. “Now let’s yell at them for 3 days re: their 22 minute trailer/concession ad before the movie.” ',?
'Medium Publishing platform Medium may be blocked in China, reports say Blogging site possibly inaccessible since early this week after post about Panama Papers leak, which China internet regulators have moved to censor reports about A woman loads a Chinese microblog website on her phone in Beijing. If block is confirmed, Medium would join other blogging platforms China has already blocked. Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters Reuters Friday 15 April 2016 15.21 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 15.54 EDT Share on WhatsApp A US-based online publishing platform, Medium , has been blocked in China, according to users and tests by Reuters, the latest service to apparently be affected as Beijing exerts greater control over the internet. Medium, which allows users, including companies and media outlets, to post blogs that readers can annotate, has been inaccessible since at least early this week, according to internet users in China and tests by Reuters using tools developed by anti-censorship watchdog GreatFire.org. It was not immediately apparent why Medium was blocked. China’s internet regulator did not respond to a faxed request for comment. San Francisco-based Medium did not respond to emailed questions outside normal US working hours. Last week, a Medium post about the Panama Papers leak, detailing the offshore wealth of various countries’ leaders and their relatives, including China’s, was widely shared on Chinese social media. China has moved to limit access to coverage of the matter and has censored online reports about it. Also last week, Medium said more than a dozen media outlets would start publishing on its site, an arrangement that would have allowed publications whose websites are blocked in China to reach users in the country. If confirmed, Medium would join a range of sites already blocked in China, including the blogging platforms WordPress and Google’s Blogger. The websites of several major media outlets are also blocked, including those of the Economist and Time, which both become inaccessible last week after they ran articles critical of President Xi Jinping. Under Xi, the government has tightened control on the internet and sought to codify that policy in the law. Officials say internet restrictions are needed to ensure security in the face of rising threats, such as terrorism. Foreign governments and business groups have pointed to restrictions on the Internet as a broader trade issue. On Friday, a US business lobby said internet restrictions were hampering business and that the free flow of information was critical to China’s effort to promote innovation. ',?
'Stage Brunel’s Thames tunnel (and accidental brothel) becomes new arts space The entrance hall to Brunel’s 19th-century tunnel under the Thames has been turned into a unique auditorium, complete with the rumble of Tube trains Scorched with soot … the Grand Entrance Hall, London, part of the Brunel Museum. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex shutterstock Friday 15 April 2016 06.47 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 10.30 EDT Share on WhatsApp The engineers Marc and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel would have approved, the director of the Brunel Museum Robert Hulse reflected, as he removed the legs from a Bechstein grand piano and helped wrestle it down a twisting staircase into the massive iron shaft they sank into the banks of the Thames 190 years ago. Pinterest The entrance to the Grand Entrance Hall. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX/Shutterstock The space they designed as their Grand Entrance Hall, which in the early 19th century led the way down to an engineering feat described as the eighth wonder of the world – the first ever road tunnel under a river – has now become one of the capital’s most dramatic performance spaces . It has been fitted with lighting and sound equipment, but left with the scarred walls where the Brunels’ original staircase was ripped out, still scorched with soot from the years it spent as a ventilation shaft for steam trains running through the tunnel. The newly created access is via a ramp around the outside of the shaft, then a new oak and steel staircase designed by Jerry Tate of Tate Harmer. He said they tried to keep the space as raw as possible, preserving every possible scrap of the Brunels’ work, now Grade II* listed. High up on the wall, there is a little barred entrance passage which has its own place in engineering history: when there was a collapse during the construction, the river burst through the half-excavated tunnel and up the shaft, killing six men. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then a teenager, was washed so high up the shaft that a foreman dragged him out of the water by his coat collar. He was more dead than alive, but survived to build marvels including the Great Western Railway, the Clifton suspension bridge and the SS Great Britain. It turns out that their enormous shaft, 50 feet (15m) in diameter and 50ft deep, built on land and allowed to sink into the ground under its own weight – “a giant pastry cutter”, Hulse said – has a superb acoustic. The piano and the two voices of singers from Popup Opera will give two performances of Bellini’s I Capuleti e i Montecchi there next week. Performances will have regular interesting rumbling noises though: London Overground trains still run through the Brunel tunnels, the oldest part of the London Transport network. “We specialise in performing in unusual spaces,” Popup Opera founder Clementine Lovell said, “and as soon as we saw this we knew it was for us.” ',?
'Radiohead Radiohead have not yet decided whether to stream new album, says man from their management firm Brian Message of Courtyard Management says he is ‘praying every night’ that the band decide to put their next record on Spotify Thom Yorke … Still making his mind up. Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images Friday 15 April 2016 06.39 EDT Last modified on Friday 15 April 2016 08.27 EDT Share on WhatsApp Radiohead have still not decided whether to allow their new album to be streamed on Spotify. Speaking at the Wanstead Tap cafe in London on Thursday night, Brian Message – of the band’s management company, Courtyard Management – said he’s “praying every night” that lead singer Thom Yorke lets Spotify have the album, but a final decision is yet to be made. As previously reported , Message told the audience of just 30 people that the new album would be released in June. He refused to reveal its name, but billled the album as “something that will probably make many of us go, ‘Wow!’”. He continued: “There’s nothing out there right now that sounds anything like this. And for some people that will be a good thing and for others that probably won’t.” Related: Radiohead manager reported saying new album will arrive in June However, the precise form of its release remains uncertain. “I’m looking forward to the day it does come out,” Message said. “And I hope – I really hope – it does come out on streaming services. To say that’s been answered, believe me it hasn’t, but I’m praying every night that it does.” The news is unsurprising in some respects. Yorke has been vocal in his criticism of streaming for years, once calling Spotify “ the last desperate fart of a dying corpse ”. But Message insisted Yorke’s criticism was largely down to the fact streaming’s potential had yet to be realised. “There should be 200 million-plus paying subscribers [on streaming sites], but there aren’t. So when you’re stuck in the trenches and there are still under 100 million subscribers, it’s hard [to see the benefits of streaming].” Message used much of his talk to criticise the secondary ticketing market, through which companies buy up gig tickets at normal value and sell them on at vastly inflated prices. The band have tried to stop this happening on their forthcoming European tour by limiting tickets to two per person and saying buyers must be named on tickets and supply ID when they arrive at venues. But apparently that has not stopped secondary sellers from trying to get in on the market for the shows, for which tickets sold out in minutes . “Viagogo had people buying or repeatedly trying to get hold of tickets and they managed to get 19 across each of the three nights at the Roundhouse,” Message said. “They’ve since sold them for £1,000 each. So what’ll happen on those nights is a Viagogo employee will walk into the venue with another person pretending to be their friend. Related: Gone in 20 minutes: Radiohead tickets for the Roundhouse, an impossible mission “You can try to limit the secondary ticketing market as much as we have, but the next step is you only being able to buy one ticket per transaction. And that’d probably be a bit of a lonely, strange gig: 3,000 singles, all in the same room, all mostly men. It’d be a bit weird.” Message, whose company, ATC, also manages Nick Cave and PJ Harvey, said his own embrace of technology was still limited. “We’ve been tap dancing around with a number of our acts with virtual reality for years, and there’s a lot of people super excited about it. Samsung are bringing out new things with it [all the time]. But I’m personally still struggling with where it’s at as a format. “What I love about streaming is if you’re a kid, with your headphones in, it’s cool. On the bus or the tube, it ticks a load of boxes, you can go into your own world. But the concept of sitting on a bus with your fucking VR headset on? Maybe I’m just getting too old.” Initial reports, the Guardian’s included, described Message as Radiohead’s manager. In fact, he is a partner in Courtyard Management, with Radiohead’s affairs being handled by Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge. Radiohead have stated that his quotes should not be taken as being on behalf of the group. This story was amended on 15 April. Brian Message is a partner in Radiohead’s management company rather than their manager. ',?
'Scams Sim-swap fraud claims another mobile banking victim Chris Sims’ account emptied and loan for £8,000 taken out as fraudsters continue to exploit way banks use customers’ mobiles Chris Sims, still shocked at having his bank account emptied and a loan taken out in his name. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer Share on WhatsApp Chris Sims was sitting in his Nottingham home a fortnight ago when his iPhone, on the EE network, suddenly stopped working. Within 75 minutes the fraudsters who had hijacked his phone had, through his online banking app, emptied his bank account of £1,200 and applied for an £8,000 loan in his name. But Sims is just the latest victim of a financial scam that is sweeping Britain: sim-swap fraud. When Sims rang EE, it soon emerged that someone posing as his wife had managed to persuade the mobile network to activate a new sim card – in effect giving the fraudsters control of his mobile number. The crooks were then able to reset all his mobile banking passwords, using his phone as identity, and the passwords being sent to the phone. Related: Mobile banking in the spotlight as fraudsters pull £6,000 sting The mobile phone companies say they first started seeing this sort of fraud in late 2015, and admit it is growing rapidly. Sims says that when he contacted his bank, Halifax, the call centre told him it is handling hundreds of sim scams every day, making it the fastest growing fraud in the country – although Halifax later disputed this figure. It appears that fraudsters have identified a significant vulnerability in the way banks are using their customers’ mobiles to identify them – and exploiting it to the max. “One minute I’m wondering why my phone won’t work, and less than two hours later my bank account has been emptied and I have an £8,000 loan,” says a still shocked Sims. “What has really annoyed me is EE’s attitude. It told me it has recordings of two calls where the fraudster tried to take over my account but failed the security questions. You’d think this might have set alarm bells ringing, but it didn’t. Then, on the third attempt, they were happy to cancel my sim. I have asked to hear this call but EE mysteriously didn’t record it, which I find very convenient.” He says he has no idea why his phone was targeted. It is actually on a shared account in his wife’s name, although he pays the monthly bill from his bank account. Her phone worked as normal. “They appear to have used the phone to tell Halifax that I had forgotten all my online bank settings. When my settings were reset, the bank sent notification to my phone – which of course, went to the fraudsters. If your bank’s security is only as good as EE’s then God help us all. I’ve been contacted by another woman who this has happened to twice. I won’t be using mobile banking again,” Sims says. EE said it has recordings of two calls where the fraudster failed security. You’d think this would set bells ringing Chris Sims EE says it has “strict policies and procedures in place to prevent fraudulent activity and unauthorised access”. It adds: “All requests to make account changes, including swapping a sim, require the person to provide a range of details to verify their identity, and in this case the correct password was given. While we continue to improve defences against this type of fraud, customers should use unique and strong passwords for each of their accounts and contact their network provider, their bank and the authorities immediately if they notice any issues.” Before a sim can be cancelled and reissued, the mobile phone network will ask a number of security questions, which only the phone owner should know the answer to. This suggests that fraudsters have already gathered a considerable amount of information on their victim. The mobile phone companies say these details may have been hoovered up from social media accounts such as Facebook, or possibly bought on the “dark web”. But they also admit that they and the banks need to do more to fight this new menace. Halifax tells us that it “ invests heavily in detection systems to ensure robust controls are in place. To protect our customers we are working with industry and network providers on a number of initiatives, including sim-swapping”.It adds: “We are sorry to hear that on this occasion Mr Sims fell victim to fraudsters who were able to remove funds from his account following a sim-swap. Where a customer is a victim of fraud we look to refund, provided the customer has taken reasonable steps to keep their own security information safe. As such, as soon as Mr Sims notified us of the fraud, we immediately refunded the money he had lost.” Related: Met chief suggests banks should not refund online fraud victims Guardian Money has also recently reported on the case of John Ellard from Hertford whose Nationwide account was emptied of £6,000 after fraudsters apparently took over his O2 mobile account. Our earliest case of a fraudster using a victim’s mobile to access their bank account was in September last year, when we featured Emma Franks who had £1,500 taken after thieves took over her Vodafone account. Someone had reported her sim card water-damaged, and requested a replacement. ',?
'Hacking Journalist gets two-year sentence for helping Anonymous hack LA Times Matthew Keys was convicted of giving login credentials to the hacking group, in a decision civil liberties group calls ‘prosecutorial discretion run amok’ Matthew Keys, right, pictured with his attorney in 2013. Keys said the case was a ‘very heavy-handed prosecution’. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP Wednesday 13 April 2016 20.04 EDT Last modified on Thursday 14 April 2016 10.38 EDT Share on WhatsApp Matthew Keys, a journalist found guilty of conspiring with hacking group Anonymous to break into the Los Angeles Times website, was sentenced to two years in prison on Wednesday in a case that has sparked national debate about how the US prosecutes hacking offenses. Keys, who was found guilty of three criminal counts in October , was convicted of giving Anonymous login credentials to the computer system of the Tribune Company, which owns the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Baltimore Sun and other media companies. Prosecutors alleged that a hacker used information Keys provided to change the headline of a 2010 Times story. KTXL-TV, a Tribune-owned Fox affiliate in Sacramento, had previously fired Keys, and the US attorney’s office asserted that the incident was payback by a disgruntled former employee. Related: Anti-Trump campaign sparks civil war among Anonymous hackers Soon after a judge announced the sentence in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday, Keys, who has a large social media following, tweeted that he was pushing forward with an appeal, adding: “[W]e’re not only going to work to reverse the conviction but try to change this absurd computer law, as best we can.” Reached by phone after the decision, Keys added, “It’s fairly common knowledge at this point that this was a very heavy-handed prosecution.” In a short post on Medium before the hearing, Keys wrote, “I hope that our combined efforts help bring about positive change to rules and regulations that govern our online conduct.” He further argued that prosecutors have overly broad discretion to bring excessively punitive terrorism charges against people for minor offenses online. “Until the law catches up with the times, there’s no doubt that prosecutors will do it again,” he wrote. Keys, now 29, was fired from his job as a social media editor at Reuters news agency when prosecutors first filed charges in 2013. He has continued reporting as his case has moved forward. The Electronic Frontier Foundation , a not-for-profit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world, has argued that Keys’s case was an example of “prosecutorial discretion run amok”, criticizing the controversial federal anti-hacking statute known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. “This case underscores how computer crimes are prosecuted much more harshly than analogous crimes in the physical world,” the EFF wrote after he was convicted. In the interview on Wednesday, Keys said he hoped his appeal would result in reforms. “We have a real shot of narrowing the applicability of the law so that this doesn’t happen to anybody else.” Regarding assertions that his crimes constituted terrorist acts , he added, “I think that anybody who has met me, anybody that’s followed my work would highly dispute that.” “I didn’t ask for this fight, this fight came at my door,” he continued. “It was an opportunistic prosecutor that seized the moment.” Keys said he was hopeful that his attorneys could fight the conviction and sentence, saying he intends to keep practicing journalism. “Being able to continue working is very important to me. I’m not going away soon.” Federal officials praised the sentencing in statements after the hearing. “This sentence serves as a warning that those who engage in this type of behavior face harsh penalties,” Tom Osborne, the FBI’s assistant special agent in charge, said in a statement. US attorney Benjamin Wagner added, “Although he did no lasting damage, Keys did interfere with the business of news organizations, and caused the Tribune Company to spend thousands of dollars protecting its servers. Those who use the internet to carry out personal vendettas against former employers should know that there are consequences for such conduct.” ',?
'iPhone 5C FBI paid professional hackers to gain access to San Bernardino iPhone – report Hackers reportedly supply zero-day exploit to allow US law enforcement entry to device, which may put older iPhones at risk of cyber criminals Should the iPhone 5C hack bought by the FBI be sold or passed onto cybercriminals, millions of older iPhones could be left vulnerable to hacking. Photograph: Rex/Zuma Share on WhatsApp The FBI reportedly bought a previously unknown security bug from a group of professional hackers to gain entry to the San Bernardino iPhone 5C, according to the Washington Post . The report suggests hackers supplied at least one so-called zero-day flaw in the iPhone 5C’s security that allowed the FBI to circumvent the lockscreen and automatic wipe feature that kicks in after 10 wrong passcode entries. The hack meant the FBI dropped its attempt to force Apple to create software to unlock the iPhone 5C , which the company said would put all iPhones at risk. The FBI has already clarified that the hack bought for a one-time-fee cannot break into newer iPhones , including the iPhone 5S or later, but the hack could affect any iPhone 5C or older, including the iPhone 5 and 4S. The hackers are said to be professional security experts who probe software, devices and services to find vulnerabilities that they can exploit. They then sell the bugs to governments and third-parties, including those who make surveillance tools similar to the software exposed during a data breach of Italian firm Hacking Team . The security bugs are not disclosed to the makers of the software or hardware, in this case Apple, because they only retain value while functional. The US government has yet to decide whether it will disclose the vulnerability to Apple , but its hand may be forced if it is required to disclose the information in a criminal case under the rules of discovery. It is unknown how the hack operates or whether the hackers sold the flaw to any other agencies or third-parties, but if it is not disclosed to and fixed by Apple, it could leave anyone with an iPhone without a fingerprint sensor at risk of having their smartphone hacked.

The Cyberspace Administration of China said the companies had promised to “handle in a timely way terror-related harmful, illegal information, create a clear internet space and maintain social stability”. The companies which have signed up include Baidu Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, JD.com and Sina Corp, the regulator said. Tencent, Alibaba, JD.com and Sina did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Baidu spokesman declined to comment. The regulator said that more than 25,000 posts, 4,000 videos and 200 accounts had been removed from the internet so far this year that involve illegal, terror-related content. China passed the anti-terrorism law in December. Among other things, it requires technology firms to help decrypt information and cooperate with the government in fighting terrorism. Critics say China uses its counter-terror and national security regulations to quell free speech. Under President Xi Jinping, the government has implemented an unprecedented tightening of internet controls and sought to codify the policy within the law. China has rebuffed the criticism of the law, saying it is simply doing what western nations already do in asking technology firms to help fight terror. The law has caused particular unease in western capitals as it codifies sweeping powers for the government to combat perceived threats. China says it faces a serious threat from groups such as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which operates in China’s restive far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where hundreds have died in violence in recent years. Rights groups and many foreign experts though say China has never presented any convincing evidence to prove ETIM exists as a cohesive, well-organised group capable of the kinds of attacks China blames it for.

'Data and computer security Philippine electoral records breached in ’largest ever’ government hack Almost 55 million Filipinos are at risk of cybercrime after a database was stolen from Comelec, the country’s electoral commission A woman looks at a ballot paper during mid-term elections in Manila on May 13, 2013. Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images Monday 11 April 2016 07.03 EDT Last modified on Monday 11 April 2016 10.20 EDT Share on WhatsApp The personal information of more than 50 million Filipinos has been exposed in a breach of the Philippine electoral commission. According to security researchers at Trend Micro , the hack contains a huge amount of very sensitive personal data, including the fingerprints of 15.8 million individuals and passport numbers and expiry dates of 1.3 million overseas voters. The website of the Commission on Elections, Comelec, was initially hacked on March 27 , by a group identifying itself as Anonymous Philippines, the local fork of the wider hacker collective. The homepage was defaced with a message accusing Comelec of not doing enough to ensure the security of voting machines used in the country’s upcoming election. “One of the processes by which people exercise their sovereignty is through voting in an election,” the message read. “But what happens when the electoral process is so mired with questions and controversies? Can the government still guarantee that the sovereignty of the people is upheld?” The same day, a different but related group, LulzSec Pilipinas, posted an online link to what it claimed was the entire database of Comelec. The 338GB database contains 75.3m individual entries on the electoral register, with 54.28m of them not tagged as disapproved – about the same number as the 54.36 million registered voters in the Philippines. That makes this hack potentially the “biggest government related data breach in history”, according to Trend Micro, “surpassing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) hack last 2015 that leaked PII, including fingerprints and social security numbers (SSN) of 20 million US citizens.” It even exceeds last week’s record-breaking release of personal information from the Turkish citizenship database, which contained records on 49 million people, the population of half the country. Trend Micro warns that the Philippine hack leaves citizens open to risk from crime. “Cybercriminals can choose from a wide range of activities to use the information gathered from the data breach to perform acts of extortion. In previous cases of data breach, stolen data has been used to access bank accounts, gather further information about specific persons, used as leverage for spear phishing emails or BEC schemes, blackmail or extortion, and much more.” In a statement given in late March, Comelec downplayed the effect of the hack. “I want to emphasise that the database in our website is accessible to the public. There is no sensitive information there. We will be using a different website for the election, especially for results reporting and that one we are protecting very well,” a spokesman said. But Trend Micro says its investigations “showed a huge number of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII)–including passport information and fingerprint data–were included in the data dump.” ',?
'Hacking Man hacked random-number generator to rig lotteries, investigators say New evidence shows lottery machines were rigged to produce predictable jackpot numbers on specific days of the year netting millions in winnings ‘Computer whiz’ rigged lottery number generator to produce predictable numbers a couple of times a year. Photograph: Brian Powers/AP Friday 8 April 2016 05.49 EDT Last modified on Friday 8 April 2016 07.25 EDT Share on WhatsApp A lottery security director who was convicted of fixing a $16.5m lottery jackpot also allegedly rigged several other lottery random-number generators to be able to predict the winning numbers, according to Iowa investigators. For several years, Eddie Tipton, the former security director of the US Multi-State Lottery Association, installed software code that allowed him to predict winning numbers on specific days of the year, investigators allege. The random-number generators had been erased, but new forensic evidence has revealed how the hack was apparently done. Tipton was convicted last year of rigging the $16.5m jackpot in Iowa, and is now awaiting trial on charges linking him to prizes in Colorado, Wisconsin , Oklahoma and Kansas. Tipton was charged after authorities released surveillance footage of a person buying the winning ticket for a $16.5 million Hot Lotto jackpot and hot dogs at a Des Moines gas station in 2010. Colleagues identified the buyer as Tipton, a so-called computer whiz who had unparalleled access to lottery software. Now forensic evidence, described as a “breakthrough” by investigators, have led to charges being filed against Tipton’s younger brother, Tommy Tipton, a former justice of the peace and reserve police officer in Texas for his role in securing the Colorado and Oklahoma jackpots, which allegedly netted him $1.2m in cash. He surrendered to authorities and was released on bail. Documents filed on Wednesday show Wisconsin authorities recovered the random-number generator used for a $2m Megabucks jackpot claimed in 2008 by Eddie Tipton’s friend, Robert Rhodes. He is fighting extradition from Texas to Iowa, where he faces charges. Two ‘lucky’ days a year The number generator had apparently been hacked to produce predictable numbers on three days of the year, after the machine had gone through a security audit. All six prizes linked to Tipton were drawn between 2005 and 2011 on either 23 November or 29 December. Investigators were able to recreate the draws and produce “the very same ‘winning numbers’ from the program that was supposed to produce random numbers,” said the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agent Don Smith. Tommy Tipton first came under scrutiny in 2006 when he was discovered with $500,000 in cash in consecutively marked bills. He claimed to have won a share of a $4.5m Colorado Lotto jackpot and that he had recruited a friend to collect the winnings to avoid his wife finding out during divorce considerations. Randy Schaffer, representing Tommy Tipton, said his client “took the high road” by surrendering rather than fighting extradition. Schaffer said: “This is a guy who, until a few months ago, was a judge. He’s going to hopefully … be professional and responsible in his dealings.” ',?
'iPhone 5C San Bernardino iPhone hack won’t work on newer models, says FBI Director James Comey says US government in discussions over whether to reveal details of purchased hack that only works on 5C and older devices FBI confirms its iPhone 5C hack will not work on newer iPhones with fingerprint scanners, including the 5S, 6 and 6S. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Thursday 7 April 2016 11.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 7 April 2016 11.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey has confirmed that the law enforcement agency’s hack on the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone 5C will not work on newer iPhones. Talking to students at Ohio’s Kenyon College – Comey’s alma mater - he said: “We have a tool that works on a narrow slice of iPhones. The world has moved onto [iPhone] 6s and this doesn’t work on 6s or on iPhone 5Ss.” The FBI director confirmed that the hack works on the iPhone 5C and older Apple smartphones, but not newer models with a fingerprint sensor. This is probably because older phones lack the so-called secure enclave, which protects passcodes, security keys and handles the security of the phone’s encryption system. Comey confirmed that the FBI bought a tool from a third party, negating the need to continue its legal action against Apple. But the FBI has yet to disclose publicly how the hack that unlocked the iPhone 5C works, despite informing senators about it . Comey said: “We’re having discussions within government about it … if we tell Apple they’re going to fix it and we’re back to where we started.” Recording of Comey’s Kenyon College address. The FBI’s hand might be forced if the hack is required in a criminal case, as the information will have to be divulged under the rules of discovery. The hack is also “perishable”, according to Comey, because at any moment Apple could update iOS for the iPhone 5C and render the hack inoperable. The FBI director also confirmed that the federal agency could help local and state law enforcement by simply unlocking the older iPhones for them, but that evidence gained this way could not be used in court. Comey wouldn’t comment on who the company or persons the hack was purchased from. He would only say that “their motivations align with ours” and that the FBI and the hack provider were “very good at keeping secrets”. ',?
'iPhone 6S iPhone 6S security hole lets attackers access contacts and photos without passcode Lockscreen flaw allows attackers to quickly access personal information on a locked iPhone 6S or 6S Plus using Siri, Twitter and 3D Touch iPhone 6S flaw allows attackers to access photos and contacts without knowing the passcode using Twitter search. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA Tuesday 5 April 2016 06.02 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 6 April 2016 07.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp A security flaw with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will let anyone bypass the phone lock and access personal information without having to know the passcode. The bug, discovered by Jose Rodriguez , who found a similar security hole last year, requires Siri but unlike many other iPhone hacks is relatively easy to execute. All an attacker needs to do is fire up Siri from the lockscreen and prompt it to search Twitter for any email address. Once one is found, 3D Touching the email address will bring up a context menu from which you can create a new contact or add to an existing contact. That gives the attacker complete access to your contacts. If the Contacts app has ever been given permission to access the iPhone’s photo library, the attacker can also browse your photos by attempting to add a photo to that new or existing contact. All that is possible without unlocking the device. Pinterest Rodriguez demonstrating the lockscreen bypass , which affects iPhone 6S and 6S Plus devices running iOS 9, including the recently released version, iOS 9.3.1. Users can protect themselves from having their photos accessed with the lockscreen bypass by simply denying Siri and the Contacts app access to their photos within the iPhone’s Privacy settings. But to prevent access to contacts through the flaw requires disabling Siri while the iPhone is locked within the Touch ID and Passcode settings. The bypass bug only affects those devices with 3D Touch screens - the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus - but comes just after FBI’s recent battles with Apple to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone 5C. The federal agency has yet to divulge how it unlocked the smartphone or whether it or the third-party that is thought to have assisted it used a security flaw similar to this one to bypass the passcode. In an advisory to US local and state law enforcement, the FBI pledged to help them unlock iPhones in criminal cases where possible. Update: Apple has fixed the issue with Siri, forcing it to ask for a passcode if searching Twitter from the lockscreen. ',?

Photograph: Rahul Tyagi “They earn around 1-1.5 lakh rupees (£1000-1500) a month without leaving their bedrooms.” Whilst India’s burgeoning population of 1.25bn means that getting a job can be tough, bounty-hunting schemes provide an easy way for young Internet enthusiasts to make a living. “People are just sitting at home with nothing to do,” Tyagi says, offering an explanation for the country’s large proportion of whitehat hackers. “They can’t get a job, so they learn this.” Tyagi’s own motivations for hacking though, are slightly different. “It’s about getting an appreciation from the giants of the world,” he says. “Hacking requires a curious and creative mind. And you have to keep learning every day, because the technology is changing so quickly.” Like many other big names on the Indian hacking scene, Tyagi comes from a humble background. “I was the first in my town to get a computer. I started on Windows 98.” His knowledge of computers earned him a reputation as the local techie when he was a teenager. “People used to invite me to their homes to install Windows XP. They’d give me food and sweets in exchange,” he says. “For them it was a big thing – that I knew so much about computers.” His first experiments with computer security were when he was just a child, trying to get a game for PlayStation 1 to work on his computer. “I was the only kid in the whole of Punjab who could do that at the time,” he says. “My first hacks were experimental. Curiosity kept me going.” Indian entrepreneurs and immigrants have been pioneers in the tech sector in the last few decades. But nobody saw India’s tech boom coming. The country has a low computer literacy rate of less than 7% and until recently , the country’s telecommunications infrastructure was weak and underdeveloped. Academics have cited the government’s non-interventionist approach as one explanation for India’s success in the IT sector. Former IT minister Pramod Mahajan once said that “IT and beauty contests are the two areas the government has stayed out of.” Prakash argues that India’s cyber security sector could grow even faster with some help from the government. “The Indian government hasn’t understood how big our potential is when it comes to hacking. The most talented hackers are Indian, the highest number of bugs are reported from here. We need to cultivate that talent.” Trishneet Arora a 22-year old hacker from the city of Ludhiana in northern India started as an ethical hacker, and has created a successful cyber security business with his skills.

'Mexico Hacker claims he helped Enrique Peña Nieto win Mexican presidential election Andrés Sepúlveda said he and other hackers installed malware to monitor opponents during 2012 campaign as part of ‘black propaganda’ operation An imprisoned Colombian hacker claimed he had manipulated elections in eight Latin American countries and Mexico, where Enrique Peña Nieto was elected in 2012. Photograph: Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images Jonathan Watts , Latin America correspondent, and David Agren Friday 1 April 2016 00.53 EDT Share on WhatsApp A digital dark arts campaign by mercenary hackers helped Enrique Peña Nieto win Mexico’s 2012 presidential election, according to an imprisoned Colombian hacker who says he was involved. Andrés Sepúlveda, an online campaign strategist, claimed he had also helped to manipulate elections in nine countries across Latin America by stealing data, installing malware and creating fake waves of enthusiasm and derision on social media. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek , the Colombian – who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence – boasted of his ability to hack into campaign networks and manipulate opinion. “My job was to do actions of dirty war and psychological operations, black propaganda, rumours – the whole dark side of politics that nobody knows exists but everyone can see,” the 31-year-old told Bloomberg. However, Sepúlveda’s claims are fiercely contested by some of those he accuses. Juan José Rendón, the Miami-based political consultant who allegedly hired the hacker, told the Guardian he had only met him once and used his service only indirectly via subcontractors for website design in 2005. “He is delusional,” Rendón said in a phone call. “All the things he describes are exactly like the TV show Mr Robot.” Denying all accusations of wrongdoing, Rendón challenged Sepúlveda and Bloomberg to provide evidence of the claims in the form of emails or CCTV footage. He also cast doubt on the suggestion that the Internet is decisive in shaping public opinion. “Can you really change the will of the people through social networks? Maybe in Ukraine or Syria where there is no alternatives. But here (in the Americas) where there is TV, a free press and door to door campaigns, it is not so influential,” he said. Although he was well paid for his work, Sepúlveda said his primary motive was political. He supported right and centre-right candidates against what he called “dictatorships and socialists governments”. In Mexico , however, he reportedly had a $600,000 budget to undermine the campaigns of Peña Nieto’s two main opponents on either side of the political spectrum: the ruling National Action party’s Josefina Vázquez Mota and the Democratic Revolution party’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador. His team are said to have installed malware at the headquarters of the two candidates, which let them monitor phones and computers. According to the report, Sepúlveda saw speech drafts, meetings plans and campaign schedules as they were typed into the keyboard. Using this information, he used a “virtual army” of fake Twitter accounts to direct public debate towards subjects that would strengthen Peña Nieto – for example by acclaiming his plan to crack down on drug violence – or embarrass rivals. Sepúlveda said he brought high-quality fake accounts that had been maintained for more than a year to make them look genuine, as well as generating 30,000 low-end Twitter bots that bumped up numbers of “likes” and “follows”, thereby creating memes and shaping discussion. “When I realized that people believe what the internet says more than reality, I discovered that I had the power to make people believe almost anything,” he told Bloomberg. The black propaganda could also be more focussed. To alienate the conservative Catholic supporters of a regional candidate in Tabasco, Sepúlveda claims he set up fake Facebook accounts of gay men to provide unwelcome support. In the swing state of Jalisco, he deliberately upset voters with automated 3am campaign calls purportedly coming from leftwing gubernatorial candidate Enrique Alfaro Ramírez – who subsequently lost by a narrow margin. Related: Mexico Catholic church accused of bending marriage rules for president To varying degrees, he said he applied similar tactics in other elections over an eight-year period in in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia , Costa Rica and Guatemala. Sepúlveda is now in jail for hacking crimes related to Colombia’s 2014 presidential election, when he tried to help rightwing opposition candidate Óscar Iván Zuluaga who opposed peace talks with the leftwing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). After several attempts on his life, he reportedly choose to go public with his allegations so he can win support for a reduced sentence. Sepúlveda said he destroyed most of the evidence and that many of the candidates he helped may be unaware of his role, which was organised via middlemen. Chief among them is Rendón, dubbed the “ Karl Rove of Latin America ”. The article cites email between the two men. But Rendón said the emails had not come from any of his accounts. Peña Nieto’s office issued a statement on Thursday night, saying: “We reject any relationship between the 2012 presidential campaign team and Andrés Sepúlveda or that there was a contract with the consultant J.J. Rendón.” The statement also disavowed the use of the “information and methods outlined by the said article”, and that, “the actions of the campaign abided by the rules and restrictions established in the applicable electoral legislation”. Jorge Ramírez Marín, a member of the Institutional Revolutionary party (PR) and vice-coordinator of the 2012 campaign, called the story: “Absolutely false. It has no basis in reality. It’s frankly fantasy.” He also pointed out the PRI was the federal opposition in 2012, though it dominated a majority of the increasingly influential and opaque Mexican state governments. López Obrador, who also finished second in a 2006 election he considers to have been rigged, said via Facebook the allegations were “nothing new, although it’s repugnant and evil”. Rendón told Bloomberg he had worked on behalf of PRI candidates for 16 years. ',?
'Share on WhatsApp Attitudes towards online abuse have undergone a sea change over the last decade. In the past, cyber-harassment – often a perfect storm of threats, impersonations, defamation, and privacy invasions directed at an individual – was routinely dismissed as “no big deal”. So it was for one Yale law student. Starting in 2007 , on an online discussion board, a cyber-mob falsely accused her of having herpes and sleeping with her dean. Anonymous posters described how they would rape her; they chronicled her daily whereabouts and prior jobs. Yet law enforcement told the student to ignore the attacks because “boys will be boys”. Officers advised her to “clean up” her cyber-reputation, as if she could control what appeared about her. Trivialising online abuse and blaming victims was the norm. There are laws available in the UK to bring to bear against online abuse Today, the public has a deeper appreciation of victims’ suffering. As advocacy groups like the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative have shown, and as society has come to recognise, the costs of cyber-harassment are steep. Because searches of victims’ names prominently display the abuse, victims have lost their jobs. They have had difficulty finding employment. Employers do not interview victims because hiring people with damaged online reputations is risky. Victims struggle with anxiety and depression. They withdraw from online engagement to avoid further abuse. Women, especially younger women, are more often targeted than men, but in either case, the abuse often has a sexually demeaning and sexually threatening cast. Legal developments reflect a growing understanding of cyber-harassment’s harms. In the US, 27 states have criminalised revenge porn – also known as non-consensual pornography. California’s attorney general Kamala Harris created a first-of-its-kind online resource to train law enforcement about cyber-harassment. Her office successfully prosecuted revenge porn operators for soliciting the posting of nude photos and charging for their removal. Inspired by Harris, the Federal Trade Commission entered into a consent decree with a revenge porn operator for inducing the disclosure of confidential information for financial gain. In the UK, cyber-harassers have been held responsible for their destruction. There are now laws to bring to bear against online abuse. Prosecutions under the Malicious Communications Act have resulted in convictions, as in the case involving death threats tweeted at Caroline Criado-Perez . In April 2015, the UK criminalised revenge pornography . What the UK still needs is better training of law enforcement and perhaps some clarification of the laws already on the books rather than a new set of laws, as the Conservative MP Maria Miller suggested this week . Related: Two jailed for Twitter abuse of feminist campaigner Even with better training the law is a blunt tool. Its effectiveness depends upon the discretion of the officials invoking it. We have seen law enforcement pursue frivolous cases , which undermine society’s confidence in harassment and threat laws. We have seen prosecutors pursue individuals who, by all societal accounts, are either trying to help others or are victims themselves . Prosecutorial overreaching and poor judgment are risks, no matter the crime at hand. But efforts to deter and prosecute crimes should not be abandoned because some prosecutors may abuse their power. Then, too, law may not be able to reach some online assaults. For instance, criminal law may not cover the individual acts of a cyber-mob, even though the abuse as a whole is destructive. Each member of a mob may have contributed a little and thus no one person has transgressed harassment laws, which require repeated “course of conduct”. There is also the practical reality of dealing with a cyber-mob. As in the case of games designer Zoe Quinn , who was targeted in “ Gamergate ”, victims have urged prosecutors to drop cases because the attacks got worse – not better – after charges were filed. Civil claims can only be brought if victims have the resources to hire counsel or find lawyers to take on cases pro bono. Since law cannot do it all, and should not do it all given our commitments to free expression, who else can combat cyber-harassment? Civil society should step in. Schools, community leaders, and family members should help inculcate norms of respect. Being told to avoid playground fights at school is par for the course – so too should be discussions about the responsibilities of digital citizenship. Young people must be taught about our shared responsibility for online safety. Private companies have a role to play as well. Indeed, market forces may be pushing them in that direction. Advertisers have threatened to pull their business unless platforms ban bigoted online abuse. Whether it is thanks to commercial interests or social responsibility, some online platforms have taken a stand against cyber-harassment. Social media providers, including Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter, now ban threats, cyber-harassment, and non-consensual pornography. Related: Insults and rape threats. Writers shouldn’t have to deal with this | Jessica Valenti Companies should be clear about their policies. They need to explain what they mean by “cyber-harassment”, “non-consensual pornography”, “threats” and “bullying”. Users will then have a better understanding of precisely what is and what is not prohibited. Platforms should explain whether content will be taken down or what the next step would be. To ensure the fairness of the complaint process, companies should notify users of their decisions and give them a chance to appeal. Of course, private companies do not owe their users any formal obligation of due process. But they should have an appeals procedure, because when people perceive a process to be fair they are more inclined to accept its results. Clear policies, a means of review, and transparent enforcement decisions will help to protect users from destructive abuse and set clear norms for sites. What about startups that lack resources to address complaints comprehensively? Users could be recruited to help enforce community norms. The multiplayer online game League of Legends has enlisted users to help address players’ abusive behaviour , notably harassment and bigoted epithets, with much success. In short, there is no magic bullet to combat cyber-harassment. But this is an opportune moment to educate the public about the destruction wrought by cyber-harassment and the various ways of addressing it. Social attitudes trivialising it can be reversed before they become entrenched. If we act now, future generations might view cyber-harassment as a disgraceful remnant of the internet’s early history.

Listen, I’ve sunk pretty low for Review Anything on occasion. For reasons I still do not fully grasp, I once reviewed a woollen ball . I reviewed pegs . Sodding clothes pegs. And yet... this. This is the lowest I’ve sunk on behalf of this feature. Rifling through bins. Here is an image of the contents I uncovered: Pinterest Here is my review of those contents: The wrapper: I don’t know what this wrapper is for because finding out would mean touching it. It looks crisp, clear and presumably wrapped whatever it was wrapping ably. The tissue: I do know what these tissues are for because I put them in there roughly half an hour before this photograph was taken. The tissues were soft – Sainsbury’s Super Soft Aloe Vera, if memory serves – and smelled very fine indeed. A second wrapper (to left of image): Bananas. This definitely contained bananas. Technically, bananas already come bunched and encased within natural wrappers, so this artificial wrapper seems slightly unnecessary. I would like to add a final note: the bin I reviewed had been emptied fairly recently. Yet more proof that the Guardian’s superlative facilities department is second to none, but not exactly conducive to a thrilling review. The bin’s contents: 4/10 The Guardian’s facilities department: 10/10 LH Pinterest The final clause of this suggestion is music to any time-pressed anything-reviewer’s ears, and I’m no exception. Conducting a comprehensive survey of “computer games based on pop stars” would be an actual journalistic enterprise that could potentially involve time and/or effort, so thank God I only had to look at about six pictures before extrapolating some intrinsically worthless judgment. (There was a YouTube video of the Frankie Goes To Hollywood game, but the amount of information contained therein was clearly not just superfluous, but actively contrary to Whitlock & Pope’s requirements. So that’s 22 minutes of my life I still have today.) You might think the more information you have, the easier it is to review anything: not so. In fact, information often complicates the reductive summaries every reviewer longs to write. So what observations can I make about computer games based on pop stars using the limited materials I have at my disposal? Well, the pixels are relatively large. Sometimes they are brightly coloured, sometimes they aren’t. Granted, attributing any sort of value to these observations is not that easy, but that’s why we employ a numerical system! 4/10 Footie selecta Idris Elba as Heimdall in Thor.

'Share on WhatsApp I am the lead developer on a multiplayer survival game named Rust . Last week, we made a change to the game that upset a lot of people: we made half of our players, picked at random, play as women. We also made some of them black. The response has been extreme. Rust is not a game about identity . The objective in Rust is to survive. This is made difficult by things such as starvation, dehydration, radiation, exposure and bear attacks. The biggest threat in the game comes from other players who are trying to survive in the same conditions. You will survive better if you’re a part of a group, but this takes a lot of mutual trust. If you kill someone you’ll be able to loot their corpse and take all their food, medicine and weapons. This makes the game very interesting socially, since players struggle with trust and slowly build up relationships with one another. Related: The identity paradox: why game characters are not us, but should be The game is in “early access”, which means it’s in active development and we update it every week. Despite this, it has sold over 3.5m copies since it was first released in 2013, and around half a million people play every week. Whenever a project has this kind of popularity, people become very passionate. But the range and strength of opinions have never been this intense. Originally every player appeared in game as a white bald guy. We were still in the early stages of development and had other things to focus on. Recently, though, we decided to change this. We decided that we didn’t want players to pick their own appearance. We felt that player customisation had got a bit out of control in other games. And we didn’t want to spend six months making a player customisation tool – we wanted to concentrate on the game. We also wanted the appearance of the players to be consistent over time. A survivor shouldn’t be able to attack another then come back later with a different gender or race and befriend the same player. They should be recognisable consistently and long-term – so anyone likely to commit a crime would be more likely to wear a balaclava or a face mask. So this is what we did. Gender and race are randomly selected and linked to a player’s account, permanently unchangeable. Inevitably, there are people who like it and people who don’t. Some players have praised what we’re doing. Like us, they think that who you are in the game, your race and gender, makes no difference to the actual gameplay – and are happy to have the diversity. Others aren’t so positive. They feel that playing a gender or race that doesn’t match their own is detrimental to their enjoyment. For race, this seems to be a regional thing. For example, most complaints about being black in the game have generally been from Russian players. With gender it seems to be more of a geography-free complaint. Here’s one of the many messages we’ve received from disgruntled male players: “Why won’t you give the player base an option to choose their gender? I just want to play the game and have a connection to the character like most other games I play. Not have some political movement shoved down my throat because you make the connection we can’t choose our gender in reality so let’s make it like that in game too.” Others have accused us of forcing them to accept our “feminist ideals”. Some have told us that they are quitting the game entirely. One called the move the dumbest thing we’ve ever done. Our female players seem more pragmatic. They point out that they’ve already being play Rust as men for the past two years. Some have got in touch to thank us. Mostly they see it as no big deal. Related: Pro-gaming tournament attempts to limit gay and transgender players We’ve also received complaints from transgender players . One called the new system horrifying, unpleasant and uncomfortable. Another argued that assigning a fixed sex was reminiscent of real-world transphobia. It’s maybe understandable why some male gamers wouldn’t want to play as women. They’re just not used to being forced to. You could probably count on your fingers the number of major, big-budget games where you have no choice but to play as a woman, never mind having no choice but to play as a black woman. Female gamers are obviously more forgiving – they’ve been playing games as men for most of their lives. I understand the arguments from transgender players – well, as much as a straight man can. But it feels to me like the same response stands. We’re assigning gender randomly in game – not in real life. Ultimately the decision comes down to gameplay. We don’t believe that letting you choose your race and gender would improve the game. On the other hand, randomising everyone’s gender and race meets all our requirements. We get an even spread of races and genders that make players more identifiable – while at the same time making the social aspects of the game much more interesting. ',?
'Pinterest Zoe Quinn, founder of Crash Override. Photograph: Samuel Kirby “One of the biggest myths is that your first response to being abused should be to go to the police and seek justice,” she wrote. “Leaving aside the fact that the police flat-out murder unarmed citizens for their race all the time, and that sex workers are likely to be incarcerated when reporting crime done to them … getting a restraining order against [him] was the least effective thing I could do in terms of getting him out of my life for good, and for protecting myself.” Quinn founded the Crash Override network , a grassroots “crisis helpline, advocacy group and resource centre” for people experiencing abuse online. Thanks to private donors and financial support from Anita Sarkeesian’s Feminist Frequency, it is free for people seeking help. Crash Override offers confidential support and advice on self-protection: how to behave if you are targeted, what to do if your home address is published, how to activate security tools on your accounts. It also offers advice on how to talk to your employer, as it’s common for abusers to bombard a target’s workplace with false accusations, hoax phone calls and other tactics designed to discredit them. Quinn says this resource is visited by over 6,000 people per month. Ferrier is also fighting back with TrollBusters , a “rescue service for women journalists, bloggers and publishers”. Ferrier prototyped the site with four other women using a $3,000 grant for women in news entrepreneurship, and later received $35,000 from the Knight Foundation , which supports quality journalism and media innovation. Twitter, Facebook and other social media tools do offer users the option to block, report or mute offenders, and sometimes people are banned or suspended. But this approach focuses on the abuser, with the target often expected to do their own labor of managing their online experience even as they face threats. Ferrier says that when targets see their online life drowned out by lies and smear messages, professional testimonials and endorsements can help support them. At the point of attack, TrollBusters sends supportive images and affirmations , like “I always take positive action in the face of fear”, into a targeted person’s social media feed. It offers what Ferrier calls a “hedge of protection”. TrollBusters teams can also document and monitor an attack so that the target doesn’t have to sit online watching the abuse unfold. “Stories of or by people of colour tend to be targeted the most,” Ferrier says. “It never matters what the topic is – we got the worst comments on a story about an African American family whose house had just burned down. “We’re talking about shutting down voices in media. Some journalists are not trained on these issues at all, and we don’t talk about the dangers of this job, both online and off,” she says. Media outlets currently don’t prepare reporters for the possibility that they might be targeted online, she says, and nor do they sufficiently account for the need to protect sources, particularly those on topics of race and gender. Harassment is complex; nobody wakes up in the morning saying ‘I’m going to be an asshole today’ Randi Lee Harper Holly Brockwell is a UK-based journalist who founded the tech site Gadgette . She recently reported on an app called Stolen , which was built around the premise of “owning” Twitter users like trading cards, without asking them whether they wanted to opt-in. Brockwell received an unsolicited notice that she was “owned” by a stranger, and wrote a story pointing out that the app could encourage online abuse. The contrite developer volunteered to take Stolen down and revisit it, but even that civil exchange brought Brockwell a flood of hate; someone tweeted her an image of her own face with semen on it. Brockwell is used to attacks, and has a policy of publicly sharing the abusive messages and images she gets. “I’m constantly told I’m making life worse for myself by calling out trolls and harassers,” she says. “I’m told I’m giving them what they want, nourishing their rotten souls with attention, giving their unhappy lives some meaning. Well, maybe I am. But that’s my decision. “Watching how someone copes with a horrendous situation isn’t your opportunity to jump in and tell them how to do it better. I’ve tried every method for dealing with harassers: blocking, ignoring, responding, reporting, mocking, crying, everything. And do you know what worked? Nothing. So the only option left is the one that makes me feel better, that gives me back some control.” Brockwell says that even with experience of harassment, it’s a challenge for any outlet, especially one led by women, to protect writers. “We had to remove our comment section very early on in the site’s existence after a series of horrific, threatening messages,” she says. But getting rid of comments doesn’t keep staff safe because “more motivated” harassers end up redoubling their efforts on things like “novel-length emails”. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook or Reddit often talk a strong game about their concern for user safety, and occasionally they invite in those who have been working closely on abuse issues, as with Twitter’s recently announced Trust and Safety Council . On Monday, the Guardian reported an initiative by Google, Facebook and Twitter to foster a global grassroots counter-speech movement . The tech firms are reaching out to women’s groups, NGOs and communities in Africa, America, India, Europe and the Middle East as the scale of online abuse continues to increase. But critics say the companies should be doing more to clean up abuse on their own sites. ',?
'Virtual reality How one developer is remaking VR rules with 1980s game Battlezone UK-based Rebellion is reviving the arcade hit as its first virtual reality game. But the company is playing by new rules One of the enemy tanks in Battlezone. Photograph: Rebellion Developments Ltd Wednesday 13 April 2016 05.47 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 13 April 2016 05.57 EDT Share on WhatsApp In some ways, 1980s arcade hit Battlezone can lay claim to being the first “virtual reality” game to hit the market. Its rudimentary vector-based graphics presented a 3D view of head-to-head tank combat, viewed by the player through a periscope-style screen. A far cry from what’s offered by the Oculus Rifts of today’s world. But squeezing your face against the viewfinder of one of the remaining cabinets, which were already old when I was young, does summon some of the same feelings. You find yourself falling into the world, aware of what you can and can’t see through the limited field of view – and, unfortunately, a bit discomfited by the sweaty physical port through which you’re staring. So it makes sense for a revived version of the game to be Oxford-based developer Rebellion’s first foray into the latest wave of VR. The company, which acquired the Battlezone brand from its creator Atari back in 2013, hopes to launch its spin on the classic alongside Sony’s Playstation VR in the autumn, with versions for the Oculus Rift and Vive following soon after. As a result, Rebellion becomes one of the growing number of developers tasked with writing the very ground rules of virtual reality. Pinterest A swarm of drones flies through Battlezone’s arena. Photograph: Rebellion Developments Ltd There’s a lot that can go wrong. The latest generation of VR devices, led by the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Playstation VR, provide a fairly intense experience. The screens, strapped to your face, occupy your entire field of view, while headphones block out the sound of the outside world. “The intensity can be a problem,” says Jason Kingsley, Rebellion’s chief executive and creative director. “We have a responsibility to make sure that people aren’t impacted, in a negative way, by this new technology.” To some extent, that’s a question of modifying what you put in the game. For instance, jump scares are beloved of horror gamers,but put that same effect in virtual reality, and even the hardiest fan may well end up tearing the headset off their face screaming. For Kingsley himself, who suffers from vertigo, a similar effect was triggered by a simulation of a rollercoaster. “Even though I knew it wasn’t real, and told myself I could overcome, I was dripping wet from sweat within seconds,” he said. But even if the content is adapted to make up for the intensity of the experience, there are other issues to deal with. Like the fact that bad VR will give you splitting headaches then make you throw up, for one. To avoid that, the game needs a high framerate and accurate head tracking, but it also needs to give up on artistic techniques which are common in games, TV and cinema. For instance, you can’t lock the field of view, and you can’t take control of the camera, explains Kingsley. It’s easy to understand why: doing so would feel as though some invisible hand had reached down and grabbed your head, twisting it to where it needs to be. And yet, without any inner-ear response, it also risks inspiring immediate nausea. But that poses a problem for any sort of storytelling if the player needs to be looking in a specific direction at a specific time. In Battlezone, this is achieved with a wide field of view, ensuring that most of what’s in front of you can be seen anyway, as well as some smart signposting in the tutorial mode. Being taught to fire your main guns doubles up as guidance to look up, and ends with you moving, not forward, but up into the roof – guidance to the player to remember their entire sphere of vision as they play. The game is also helped by being set in a futuristic tank, because the player doesn’t have to control a standing avatar. Sitting in the chair in real life is matched by sitting in the cockpit in-game, which avoids disconcerting mismatches between body positions. It also avoids a problem faced by makers of more physical VR games, where the player is standing up and walking around: namely, trip hazards. ',?
'Grand Theft Auto Rockstar dismisses $150m Grand Theft Auto lawsuit as ’bizarre’ Company claims producer Leslie Benzies exhibited ‘conduct and performance’ issues before his departure from GTA development studio, Rockstar North Grand Theft Auto V … Rockstar has rebutted allegations by Leslie Benzies, producer of the GTA series. Photograph: Rockstar Wednesday 13 April 2016 04.29 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 13 April 2016 07.26 EDT Share on WhatsApp Rockstar Games, the publisher behind the multimillion-selling Grand Theft Auto series has issued a response to the $150m (£105m) lawsuit launched against it by former employee, Leslie Benzies. In the brief statement, the company dismisses the allegations made in the 70-page suit, launched by Benzies through US law firm, Locke Lord. Benzies claims to have been encouraged to take a sabbatical in 2014, only to discover that Sam and Dan Houser, the founders of Rockstar, were conspiring to have him removed from the company. He claims that the duo sought to renege on a 2009 royalties deal which would ensure Benzies retained financial parity with the brothers. Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar has since launched a counteraction against Benzies. Through a terse statement Rockstar said: “Leslie Benzies was a valued employee of our company for many years. Sadly, the events that culminated in his resignation ultimately stem from his significant performance and conduct issues. Despite our repeated efforts to address and resolve these issues amicably both before and after his departure, Leslie has chosen to take this route in an attempt to set aside contract terms to which he previously agreed on multiple occasions. His claims are entirely without merit and in many instances downright bizarre, and we are very confident this matter will be resolved in our favour. “A core ethos since Rockstar’s inception has been the concept of ‘the team’. It is deeply disappointing and simply wrong for Leslie to attempt to take personal credit for what has always been the tremendous efforts of the entire Rockstar team, who remain hard at work delivering the most immersive and engaging entertainment experiences we can for our fans. “We do not intend to comment further on this matter.” Benzies was lead producer and a creative director of the Grand Theft Auto series since 1999 when work began on Grand Theft Auto III. He was also president of Rockstar North, the Edinburgh studio responsible for much of the development on the series. He claims that his unfair dismissal led to the loss of over $150m in royalties. Take-Two Interactive has stated in its counter action that Benzies chose to leave. His lawsuit makes many allegations about Rockstar and specifically Sam Houser, who he labels “incapable of completing large scale and complex games” without Benzies’ supervision. The suit alleges that Sam Houser became suspicious that Benzies “wanted to take over the company”, when the producer arranged for his name to appear last in the game credits to GTA Online, a multiplayer component of Grand Theft Auto V . Previously Houser’s name was always the last to appear in Rockstar production credits. A press release issued by Locke Lorde stated: “Mr. Benzies’ removal after years of receiving compensation identical to the Housers was the product of what turned out to be a lengthy deception by Sam Houser. The complaint describes Sam Houser’s mounting resentments after many years of high praise.” ',?
'Games Grand Theft Auto producer sues publisher for $150m in unpaid royalties Lawsuit claims Les Benzies was ‘enticed’ into taking a sabbatical in September 2014, a year after the release of the popular video game Grand Theft Auto V: producer Les Benzies claims he was forced out. Photograph: Rockstar Tuesday 12 April 2016 16.31 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 12 April 2016 18.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp The producer behind the multimillion-selling Grand Theft Auto video games is suing the publisher of the series, Take-Two Interactive, for $150m. Les Benzies, previously president of Rockstar North, the studio that developed the hit franchise from Grand Theft Auto III onwards, claims that he was “enticed” into taking a sabbatical in September 2014, a year after the release of Grand Theft Auto V. He then returned to the office six months later to find that his access to the building had been revoked. A press release issued by law firm Locke Lord states: “While on sabbatical, Mr Benzies discovered numerous deceptions on the part of Take-Two, Rockstar, Rockstar North Ltd, Sam Houser and Dan Houser, who sought to force him out of the company and terminate his portion of royalty payments based upon arbitrary actions by the company’s royalty Allocation Committee, a committee that may or may not have actually ever met. “As the lawsuit describes, based upon agreements in place, as one of three named Rockstar Principals, Mr Benzies is owed in excess of $150m in unpaid royalties.” The dispute centres on a 2009 royalty plan signed by Benzies and the founders of Rockstar, Sam and Dan Houser, which he claims ensured he would have parity with the brothers. Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has now filed a counter suit , claiming Benzies left the company of his own volition, and consequently is not entitled, “to any post-termination royalties”. Asked to comment on Take-Two’s counter, Christopher Bakes of Locke Lord, the chief litigator on the Benzies case, told the Guardian, “The short answer is that we believe the detailed and extensive factual allegations contained in Mr. Benzies’ Complaint amply address those contained in the somewhat sparse Take-Two Complaint. “Needless to say, Mr. Benzies believes the issues between the parties are far broader than as presented by Take-Two and Mr. Benzies’ Complaint reflects that.” Benzies is considered one of the key members of the Grand Theft Auto creative team, having been a producer on the series since the hugely successful third title, released in 2001, which saw development move from DMA design in Dundee to Rockstar North, based in Edinburgh. The Locke Lord lawsuit claims that Sam and Dan Houser, were attempting to force Benzies out of the company and that there was “mounting resentment” between Sam Houser and Benzies. The lawsuit alleges that Sam Houser was angry when Benzies put his own name at the end of the production credits for GTA Online, a multiplayer mode for Grand Theft Auto V; traditionally Sam Houser’s name is the last to be displayed in the credits for Rockstar titles. The suit alleges that the Houser said Benzies “wanted to take over the company”. According to Benzies’s suit, Rockstar threatened to make “scurrilous allegations” against him if he continued to assert his rights. “This was a shocking development given that Sam Houser himself had orchestrated and encouraged a company culture involving strip clubs, personal photography of employees in sexually compromising positions, and other conduct grossly in violation of standard workplace norms.” The Guardian has approached Rockstar and Take-Two for comment.

'Pinterest People play on machines at the pinball hall of fame in Las Vegas. Photograph: pinballhall.org Passionate and curmudgeonly, this self-proclaimed Director of Things and Stuff wonders if his replacement will ever be found. “You’ve got to ask yourself ‘Is this a Beach Boys operation or a Jan and Dean operation? If a Beach Boy dies, you can just hand somebody a surfboard and a pair of shorts and you go on. But if a Jan or a Dean dies, there goes the act.” Arnold is searching, of course, for a modern version of his younger self – a kid who fell in love with the pinball machine as a symbol of cultural rebellion. The game was born in Chicago in the 1930s, where wood from Wisconsin was plentiful for the construction of table-top machines into which a player inserted a penny to launch a ball that bounced off pins before falling into pockets for scoring. The game soon became popular in the city’s vast tavern industry and – like most things in Chicago in those days – was taken over by organized crime and turned into a gambling device. By the 1970s, the games were considered decadent in Arnold’s home town of Duluth, Minnesota, which outlawed all forms of gambling. Still, every convenience store and pizza parlor had them. “The fact that you could win a free game was considered gambling in my repressive Calvinist home town,” he said. “It was something for nothing, the forbidden fruit, and that fascinated me.” In 1972, Arnold bought his first game – a 1966 Gottlieb Mayfair machine – and charged 10 cents apiece for friends to play in his garage. He soon bought others and put them in laundromats and grocery stories. In 1976, Arnold and his younger brother opened Pinball Pete’s, just outside East Lansing, Michigan. Their timing was as perfect as a well-played pinball: the video-screen revolution with its blinking, beeping, crazy-colorful silk screens became a huge fad. Business quadrupled. Soon the brothers were running seven arcades in Michigan. Here, the story pauses. Suddenly, a woman is in Arnold’s face: “We put a dollar in the change machine but only 50 cents came out,” she says. He sighs and trundles off to help her. As he returns to his work, he spots a kid slamming the glass of a nearby machine. “Hey!” he yells across the room. “Don’t pound on the machine!” Soon, an eight-year-old boy is standing at his side. “Do you work here?” he asks. Arnold shoots him a “Go away kid, ya bother me” look. The boy has lost 50 cents in a machine. Arnold hands him two quarters. “Play something else,” he commands. ',?
'Apple iPhone SE review – too small for most people 4 / 5 stars Taking the guts of the iPhone 6S and squeezing them into the frame of the iPhone 5S is great, but only those who really want a 4in phone should buy one The Apple iPhone SE is one of the best smaller phones available, but its 4in screen is just a bit too small for 2016. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Wednesday 13 April 2016 02.00 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 13 April 2016 02.02 EDT Share on WhatsApp With the iPhone SE everything that is old is now new again, but is that a good thing and is a small, 4in smartphone really up to scratch in 2016? The new iPhone SE comes in at the bottom end of Apple’s iPhone range on cost, below the iPhone 6S and 2014’s iPhone 6, a spot typically filled by last year’s model. It’s now the only smartphone Apple makes with a screen smaller than 4.7in, which for some could be a big deal. For others it could be a deal breaker. iPhone 5, 5S or iPhone SE? Pinterest All-metal body, glass top and bottom and a glass-front, a mirror image of the iPhone 5 and 5S. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone SE is the spitting image of the iPhone 5S. The only differences are that the edges are the same colour and texture as the back of the device, it comes in rose gold, the Apple logo on the back is shiny, and there’s a small “SE” emblem on the back, reminiscent of the Machintosh SE from 1987. It’s still relatively slender at 7.6mm thick - its hard square edges make it feel thicker than it is - and it weighs 113g, which is quite light for a smartphone these days. Then again, it’s very small for a smartphone in 2016. The screen is the same as the 5S, 4in on the diagonal with the same quality colours, brightness and blacks. Compared to the iPhone 6S the screen is noticeably weaker, with poorer blacks and vibrancy. It’s not a bad screen by any stretch of the imagination, it’s just a good screen from two years ago, which is exactly what it is. In the hand the body feels sharp and hard, with unforgiving edges which are only acceptable because of the phone’s diminutive size. The hard edges are easier to grip than the slippery rounded sides of the iPhone 6S, and particularly the large 6S Plus, but they hurt my palms after clutching it for an hour or two. The iPhone SE’s closest rival is the excellent Sony Xperia Z5 Compact , which has a significantly larger 4.6in display, weighs 138g, is 8.9mm thick and has slightly larger dimensions. Practically no other 4in devices in this high-end category exist anymore. Using a 4in screen in 2016 is a compromise. Websites feel very cramped, apps often leave only a small amount of screen to the content they’re trying to display and buttons can end up very small making tapping them a bit of a challenge. The display is decent, but not quite as good as modern displays on today’s top-end smartphones. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Specifications Screen: 4in 1136 x 640 pixels (326 ppi) Processor: dual-core Apple A9 RAM: 2GB of RAM Storage: 16/64GB; no SD card Operating system: iOS 9.3 Camera: 12MP rear camera, 1.2MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm Weight: 113g Three generations in one device Pinterest The Touch ID sensor is slower than the one on the iPhone 6S, which makes it easier to see the lockscreen, but also forces you to wait a second or so to get to the homescreen. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian When you dig into the innards of the iPhone SE things start to get more interesting. It has a combination of iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S parts. The processor and graphics chip is an Apple A9 from the iPhone 6S, which makes it as fast as its bigger brother. It also has 2GB of RAM - double the iPhone 5S - which makes multitasking or browsing multiple tabs in Safari a lot faster with less reloading. Performance is much faster overall than the iPhone 5S and feels similar to that of the iPhone 6S, apart from the fingerprint sensor, which is pretty slow for a 2016 smartphone costing £350+. It’s the same original Touch ID sensor from the iPhone 5S/6, not the new, much faster Touch ID sensor from the 6S, which is disappointing. The iPhone SE’s battery life is better than the 6S, mirroring that of the 6S Plus. Using it as my main device, with hundreds of emails, push notifications, three hours of browsing and listening to music - without the Facebook app installed - the iPhone SE lasted a solid working day. I went to bed with 10% battery left and work up eight hours later with 5%. Compared to other iPhones, most will see better battery out of the SE, but it doesn’t come close to its closest Android competitor, the Xperia Z5 Compact , which lasted as long as three days between charges. Call quality was excellent. I also didn’t suffer from the reported Bluetooth audio issues . iOS 9 Pinterest The iPhone SE runs Apple’s latest version of iOS 9.3.1 with Night Mode, which reduces the blue light emitted by the display intended to help you sleep. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone SE comes loaded with iOS 9.3 , which currently runs on the iPhone 4S and newer, including the iPhone 5S. It includes features such as Apple’s Night Mode, which reduces the amount of blue light emitted by the display in the evening to help you sleep. It’s the exact same version running on the iPhone 6S currently and behaves as such, minus the 3D Touch gestures that the SE does not support. It’s worth noting that iOS works better on smaller devices, where your thumb can reach all areas of the screen. Activating the Control Center feels more consistent, as does swapping between apps using the task switcher on the smaller screen. Pinterest The camera is the same as the iPhone 6S and as such is very good, if not quite the best. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The rear camera is the same 12-megapixel shooter as fitted in the iPhone 6S and performs as such. It’s one of the better cameras available on a smartphone, with good detail and colour balance, but it has been bettered recently by cameras from Samsung , Sony and Google . It is a big step up from the iPhone 5S with 4K video recording and Apple’s Live Photos, which are nice to play with but end up being a gimmick that’s difficult to share with non-iPhone users. The 1.2-megapixel selfie camera, however, is the same as that fitted to the iPhone 5S and is distinctly worse than the rear camera or that fitted to the iPhone 6S, which is a shame. It will shoot decent selfies in good light, but struggles in low-light conditions. Price The iPhone SE is available in four colours and two storage options costing £359 for 16GB of space and £439 for 64GB of space. For comparison, the iPhone 6S costs £539 , the iPhone 6 costs £459 and the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact costs £300. Observations It took a full phone reset to get iCloud Music/iTunes Match to work properly, which was deeply irritating . Do not buy the 16GB version unless you can help it. 16GB of storage will rapidly be filled up with apps, videos, music and photos. The iPhone SE will fit in any cases and take any accessories designed for the iPhone 5S or 5 Apple Pay is supported, unlike the 5S Compared to larger phones the SE feels more robust Typing on the 4in screen is quite fiddly and slow - my thumbs clashed on the tiny keyboard My hands started to cramp after half a day trying to grip the small phone The hard edges were sore on my palms and are a downgrade over the iPhone 5S. Stick it in a case. The iPhone SE lacks 3D touch and the Taptic engine from the iPhone 6S, which means many of the new gestures built into iOS9 for swapping between apps etc are not available. Verdict The iPhone SE is one of the best of the very few small phones still available. It would be a significant downgrade from an iPhone 6, isn’t a quantum leap over the iPhone 5S and should only really be considered if size is the overriding factor. It might make a good first iPhone, but it feels like a step backwards - the 4in screen is very small for browsing, viewing photos, apps, games and typing. Smartphones , and what we consume on them, have moved on in the four years since a 4in iPhone was first unveiled, and the iPhone SE feels much less engaging than a 6S. It is much more pocketable, easier to grip and costs less, but it still isn’t a “budget” iPhone and is still relatively expensive compared to competing smartphones from other manufacturers. Pros: one-day battery, good rear camera, decent screen, easy to hold, easy to fit in a pocket, fits in existing iPhone 5 accessories Cons: very small screen, edges are hard on hands, looks like an iPhone 5 or 5S, selfie camera isn’t great, no expandable storage or removable battery Other reviews ',?
'It’s behind you… In the spotlight: capture your rear view with a Cycliq A few years ago some pro-cycling teams started using “saddle cams” to give fans an unprecedented rider’s-eye view of life in the peloton. Most of the cameras are fitted to the seat post and record what is happening behind the racer. The thrill of a bunch sprint is unbelievable – though you always end up feeling slightly sick watching the footage as you can only look backwards. Anyway, you can now record what happens behind you thanks to a new device from a firm called Cycliq . It began after a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014 and is now making the Fly6. It’s an HD camera combined with a very bright rear light. It costs £99. A forward-facing camera called the Fly12 will also soon be available. It’s incredibly easy to use. Plug it into your computer to charge it, clip it to your seat post and you have a usable rear light. However during the day you can use the same device to record all the action from the road. You get sound and great quality footage. The battery lasts for up to six hours and the camera can be used in any weather conditions. After your ride, flip out the tiny SD card and simply load and edit on your computer. There is clearly a safety aspect to this. I suppose when you get knocked off your bike you can later view the footage to see who hit you. I have taped a few commutes through central London and it is horrifying. I made the mistake of showing my wife and she is now trying to ban me from riding. I’d rather not know just how close those taxis were… However, I think you should use the Fly6 for much happier events. A weekend ride with your mates, maybe. What price to see the look on your friends’ faces as you pass them on a long climb? I’m heading for the hills this weekend and will certainly be capturing the fun… Cycliq, £99, is distributed exclusively in the UK by Raleigh ( cycliq.com ) Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @MartinLove166 ',?
'The exported image clearly lacks most of the lighter pen strokes, while the paper has shifted slightly while drawing, making some lines appear out of place. Sketch by Cheryl Pilbeam Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Price The Wacom Bamboo Spark costs £103 with either a gadget pocket, sleeve for a smaller tablet or a snap-fit case for an iPad Air 2 . It comes with two replacement ink cartridges and a 30-page notepad of relatively poor quality. Competing systems such as the Livescribe Smartpen 3 Black Edition cost £120, but require special paper starting at around £3 for a notepad and refills costing £1 each. Verdict The Wacom Bamboo Spark is just a few features away from being great. The idea is sound - make the back of the pad smart so you can use any paper. But the A5 pad is quite limited, it moves around causing issues for notes and drawings and the app-side of the pairing, where all your digital notes are processed, is not up to scratch. Unlike competitors there’s no audio recording capability, the handwriting recognition isn’t the best, but the pen, while feeling a bit cheap, is much closer to being a normal pen than most rivals. It’s also one of the cheapest solutions available and being able to export to Wacom’s digital inking format could be very useful for those looking to use it for more than just notetaking. Pros: can use any A5 paper, decent writing experience, simple to store and transfer inking, Wacom Ink Layer Language export Cons: small pad, bulky folio, cheap-feeling pen, page moves, no voice recording, limited app, exporting can be frustrating ',?
'Pinterest A headphones cable can be plugged in for wired listening. The small ‘N’ denotes the NFC area. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Simply put, battery life was stellar. They lasted well over 25 hours between charges with ANC on, meaning they’re in the range of being able to forget about charging them for your average daily listening. Charging took a good hour or so via microUSB. If the battery does run out you can use the headphones cable, which is also a lot easier to use than Bluetooth if you’re trying to connect to a computer. Observations The headphones socket is relatively narrow, which means I could only get the supplied cable to fit The headphones provide clear audible and voice feedback for connections and when it’s time to charge them, with a female voice with a strange US-Asian accent, which was difficult to place The LED flashes red to show the battery when switched on, or pressed when on. The headphones also audibly announce the battery life if you press the power button when they are already on. They fold up relatively compact, but not flat and have a shell carry case Call quality through the headphones was decent Price The Sony h.ear on Wireless NC headphones cost £220, which makes them £90 more than the Philips SHB9850NCs , £30 more than the Plantronics BackBeat Pro , but £79 cheaper than the Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones . Verdict The Sony h.ear on Wireless NC are a good set of Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones only slightly shy of excellent. They’re comfortable for extended periods, the battery life is very long and they have good controls. The noise cancelling isn’t quite as good as the best available, and their sound profile won’t suit everyone. I would have liked a little more sparkle and liveliness, something characteristic of good high-end headphones, but they make decent all-rounders for multiple music genres. They’re neither expensive nor cheap for wireless noise cancelling headphones and offer similar if not better performance than some much more expensive competitors making them definitely worth considering. Pros: great battery life, good controls, good connectivity, comfortable, noise cancelling, hi-res support, folding for travel Cons: passive isolation could be better, noise cancelling not quite as effective as high-end competitors ',?
