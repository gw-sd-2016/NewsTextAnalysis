'THE SYRIAN WOMEN FIGHTING TO SAVE THEIR CITY Who would want to be a woman in Aleppo? The female population of Syria’s second city find themselves threatened both by the murderous misogynists of Islamic State (Isis) and the Russian allies of the president, Bashar al-Assad, whose bombing raids mean that now even bad weather offers the city no respite.  “Before, Assad’s forces were not able to drop their bombs when it was raining or cloudy, so those were days we were glad to see,” said Zaina Erhaim, a documentary filmmaker from Aleppo. “But now the Russians have come and they can bomb in these conditions, so there is no relief any more from the death that comes from the sky.”  Amid the carnage and suffering, Erhaim has just completed a documentary that attempts to a tell a story that was in danger of being forgotten: the story of the women who chose not to leave, but to stay and help a city to survive its darkest hour.  “It’s not just men fighting the war in Syria; it is women, too, and they feel forgotten,” she told the Observer. “The women activists are working harder, against more problems, but are forgotten as the west obsesses on Islamic State. It is just Assad against Isis, but we are still here in this ruined place and now we are facing two enemies, Isis and Assad.”  In Erhaim’s film, entitled Syria’s Rebellious Women and made over the past 18 months, she profiles some of her friends who have helped to document the war, deliver supplies to civilians and provide medical services in ways that some within their country now regard as unacceptable behaviour for women. “Our patriarchal traditions now have guns,” she says.  “Despite the insult the word implies, I’m not bothered any more by those who call me hurma, suggesting weakness, dependency, minor, his pleasure tool, his property, his possession,” she said. Erhaim is project co-ordinator and trainer with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) in Syria.  “As a trainer, I need to put in more effort to be taken seriously by my male trainees, who think ‘the hurma is training us!’ and ‘how could the hurma know better than the most ignorant man?’ They say that, as a woman, I have always to look for a man, any man, and assign him to be my guardian for the checkpoints. The armed men talk to my guardian at the checkpoint and he answers on my behalf, because as a woman I’m expected to be too fragile to talk to a stranger. This is the general rule, but I’m an exception, along with hundreds of women revolutionaries who resist all this.”  Erhaim filmed five women: Ghalia, Waed, Manar, Zein and Ahed. Manar has since pulled out of the project because she fears for her family’s safety. Waed persuaded her father to let her leave her family in a government-controlled town to move to Aleppo and work as a paramedic on the front lines. “Men went on the front lines,” she said, “and I worked on the front lines, too. Men carried weapons; I carried weapons, too. Men worked in field hospitals; I did that, too.”  Waed is angry that she has no rights over how she dresses and who she talks to. When she can she goes with her husband over the border into Turkey, where she can wear a dress and remove her headscarf.  Community activist Ghalia has faced repeated attacks and assassination attempts. Her teenage son waits every day for her by the door of their house until she returns safely. He has learned to cook and prepare food and to clean, duties that before the war Ghalia would have done as the woman of the house.  “I miss my old life,” she said. “I miss cooking and cleaning my home for my family.” Instead she has founded a series of centres that provide vocational training to local women, offering safe places for women to meet as well as learn first aid and other crucial skills in their war-torn lives. One of the centres was bombed by extremist Islamic forces.  “In 10 years’ time,” said Erhaim, “I want a young woman who looks on the internet to find out what happened in Syria to find evidence of the roles women played. This is why I have made this film and why all the women risk their lives to appear in it.”  She lives in Aleppo with her husband and says she is determined to go back when her film tour finishes in the US this week. Two of the women featured were supposed to travel with her but they were refused visas by Britain. They will join her this week in Washington.  “We are Syrian: we must be terrorists,” she said ruefully. “This is your nice country, thank you, but we don’t want to stay. It is my home, where my friends are, I have no intention of leaving,” she said.  The killing of many activists since the beginning of the revolution means she cannot let their deaths be in vain.  “You were with people on the demonstrations, chanting ‘I won’t let my country down and we’ll pay with our lives’, so they pay and you just leave? I can’t do that.”  Two of her friends are now working as paramedics in field hospitals from which the real doctors and nurses have long fled. Zein and Ahed both talk about how they cry while tending injured people. Both of them have suffered serious beatings by soldiers of Assad, by Islamic State and by men from other factions.  Zein spent 14 months in a government prison for taking part in demonstrations. “The detention centre is a cemetery for the living,” she says. At one point government soldiers raped a male prisoner in front of her. When she was released she found her home had been destroyed and her family had gone. “I only wanted the Free Syrian Army. I got FSA, the al-Nusra Front and Isis. We said Syria is for all. Everybody joined in.”  Zein has given up hope of getting married, or having a family. Erhaim, too, says that her husband gave up “nagging her” to have a baby after they both witnessed the aftermath of an airstrike on a nursery school near their flat. So many schools have been targeted that parents fear sending their children to school.  “I met one woman who sits outside the school all day while her five children are inside,” said Erhaim. “I said to her, you cannot protect them by sitting there. And she said ‘no, but if the classroom is hit then at least I will die with them’.”',1
'FGM: MOTHER AND RETIRED NURSE BOTH FOUND GUILTY OF MUTILATING TWO SISTERS A retired nurse and the mother of two young girls have each been found guilty of carrying out female genital mutilation in Australia’s first prosecution of an FGM case.  Related: Girl told to imagine she was 'a princess in a garden' as she underwent FGM in Australia  The mother and the nurse, who was referred to as KM, were both found guilty of carrying out FGM on each sister between 2009 and 2012 by a jury in the NSW supreme court on Thursday.  Another defendant, Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, a spiritual leader in the Dawoodi Bohra Shia Muslim sect, was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact by attempting to help cover up the FGM after police began investigating.  The FGM had been carried out on the sisters, now aged 10 and 12, when they were each about seven years old.  The older sister, known as C1, underwent FGM in the Wollongong home of a member of their community in a ceremony known as “khatna”. Her younger sister’s FGM was carried out in the family’s western Sydney home.  After the guilty verdict was delivered it was revealed that while the trial had been under way, the father of the girls had received an award for his commitment to the Dawoodi Bohra community.  C1 was told to imagine she was a “princess in a garden” while FGM was carried out on her by KM after her mother asked KM to perform the khatna ceremony.  The girl’s grandmother was also in the room and prayers from the Koran were read while the ceremony took place.  In each case the girl lay down on a bed naked from the waist down and was told to close her eyes while KM cut their clitorises with a silver tool. The girls suffered either type one or type four FGM with a cut or partial removal of their clitoreses which did not leave scar.  Justice Peter Johnson granted bail to all three despite the opposition of crown prosecutor Nanette Williams who wanted them held until sentencing on 5 February.  They each face seven years in jail.  Williams called detective sergeant Eugene Stek to give evidence opposing the bail saying the flight risk was too great. He also spoke about their increased standing in the community because of the trial.  The court heard all three had travelled overseas a number of times when they were on bail and had returned each time.  “She’s [KM] a senior member of the Dawoodi Bohra community and has a great network in respect to that community, there is a network of orthodox followers who fully support of FGM and the fact she has been convicted only enhances [that] they would do anything to protect her and assist her in fleeing,” he said.  Stek said Vaziri was arrested because he was planning to fly to India the same day. Vaziri’s counsel, Robert Sutherland SC, said he was travelling on a return ticket with his wife for an eye operation.  The mother, aged 38, and KM, aged 72, had each travelled overseas on bail and returned to Australia.  The mother’s parents live in Africa and she is in frequent contact with them.  “As an orthodox member of community being fully supported worldwide by members of the community, we believe strongly they will also help her flee the jurisdiction if the opportunity presents,” Stek said.  Police also stated concerns about the trio continuing to influence people to carry out FGM.  “The other concern is the continual, in my opinion, pressure they put other members of the community to keep FGM quiet, to continue the status quo and fight this until it goes away and everything will be alright,” Stek said.    Johnson said the flight risk could be mitigated and ordered all three surrender their passports with Vaziri asked to report to police six days a week.  The women will report twice a week.',1
'REPUBLICANS DEMAND US LEAD A NEW WAR TO ‘ERADICATE ISIS' AFTER PARIS ATTACKS Foreign policy hawks seized on the Paris terrorist attacks to argue for more aggressive military intervention in the Middle East, as national security issues assumed centre stage in the US presidential race.  Related: Paris attacks: seven arrested with one wanted man still on the run  Following a Democratic television debate on Saturday that was dominated by calls for a tougher response to Islamic State radicals, leading Republicans joined the fray on Sunday in a series of political interviews that also saw linked attacks on immigration and calls for more intelligence surveillance.  “This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our Nato allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the Nato agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,” Senator Marco Rubio said on ABC.  He was joined by his Florida rival Jeb Bush, who also demanded the US lead a new war to “eradicate Isis from the face of the earth” and warned that screening of Muslim refugees from Syria was unlikely to be fully effective in preventing terrorist infiltration of the US.  “Ultimately the best way to deal with the refugee crisis is to create safe zones inside Syria so that people don’t risk their lives and you have don’t have what will be a national security challenge both for our country and Europe,” Bush said on CNN.  “We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered,” he added, suggesting that specific efforts should take place to determine individuals’ religion before refugees were admitted into the US.  Republicans are increasingly less reticent than Democrats to describe the battle against Isis in religious terms. The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham went furthest of all the presidential candidates on Sunday by demanding an immediate ground invasion of Syria.  “The best thing the United States can do to protect our homeland is to go on offence, form a regional army – with the French involved if they would like to be – and go in on the ground and destroy their caliphate,” Graham said.  “We are going to fight [Isis] in their backyard or we are going to fight them in our backyard,” he added, arguing thousands of US troops would be needed in Syria and Iraq to “pull the caliphate up by the roots, take back land held by Isil and hold it until Syria repairs itself”.  Graham has long been an outlier even among hawkish Republicans, but his tone is increasingly matched by politicians in both parties as the White House struggles to articulate its compromise strategy of airstrikes and limited ground support from US special forces.  Administration officials were on the defensive on Sunday after a pre-recorded interview with Barack Obama in which the president boasted of “containing” Isis was rapidly overtaken by events in France.  “I don’t think they’re gaining strength,” said Obama in remarks to ABC that were recorded before the Paris attacks but after the Beirut and Russian aircraft bombings. “From the start our goal has been first to contain and we have contained them.”  On Sunday, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes insisted this was a “very specific point that the president was making”, rather than a broader claim of victory.  “There is no question that this is a very significant threat that is going to require a long-term campaign and there are going to be setbacks,” Rhodes said.  “We have to very methodically degrade this threat,” he added, pointing to fresh US attacks on a leading Isis figure in Libya.  Nonetheless, the slip has seen even Democrats distance themselves from Obama’s strategy for tackling Isis.  “It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,” said Hillary Clinton at the outset of Saturday’s second presidential debate.  “Our prayers are with the people of France tonight but that is not enough,” she added. “We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like Isis, the barbaric, ruthless, violence jihadist, terrorist group.”  Related: Democratic debate: candidates face off on foreign policy in light of Paris attacks  Clinton’s rival Bernie Sanders briefly warned that the track record of US intervention in the Middle East had not helped. But even Democrats running to the former secretary of state’s left have criticised her for not being clear enough that the US has to lead action against Isis.  “I would disagree with Secretary Clinton, respectfully, on this score,” said the former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley in the debate. “This actually is America’s fight.”  Bush also echoed calls made by the US intelligence community in the last 24 hours for the Paris attacks to lead to a rethink of recent reforms designed to protect against overly intrusive surveillance.  Meanwhile, Obama met Russian president Vladimir Putin on the fringes of the G20 summit in Turkey, to discuss diplomatic progress toward ending the civil war in Syria and call for a ceasefire.',0
'AT DOC NYC, WOMEN’S (FILM) WORK Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Thom Powers, the artistic director of Doc NYC, the largest festival of documentary films in the country, said he didn’t realize what he had done until after this year’s lineup of 104 features was released. Someone else had to point out to him that his opening night, closing night and centerpiece selections were all directed or co-directed by women.          “In a way, it’s not surprising to me,” he said in an interview last week, “because I think documentary has long been an area where women directors have really flourished.”  Depressing statistics about the status of female filmmakers seem to issue almost daily from Hollywood. Only 18 percent of first-time directors of television episodes in a recent six-year span were women. The percentage of studio films directed by women hovers just below 10 percent; narrow the field to the top 100 box-office hits, and the number drops below 5 percent.  The figures improve, however, when it comes to independent film, and they nudge even higher in documentaries. Less research has been done in these areas, but a 2012 study found that 28 percent of film festival documentaries were directed by women. The figure this year at Doc NYC, which runs from this Thursday through next Thursday at the IFC Center, the SVA Theater and the Bow Tie Chelsea Cinemas, is 37.5 percent.  “Is it all good news?” Mr. Powers asked. “Is it total parity? Of course it isn’t. There’s a lot of room to go.” But the news isn’t bad, comparatively speaking, and it extends beyond directors to powerful executives like Sheila Nevins at HBO, Lisa Nishimura at Netflix, Diane Weyermann at Participant Media and Molly Thompson at A&E IndieFilms. “These are the top decision-making positions in financing documentaries,” he said.  The films Mr. Powers chose for his most high-profile slots are Barbara Kopple’s “Miss Sharon Jones!” (opening night); Amy Berg’s “Janis: Little Girl Blue” (centerpiece); and Dyllan McGee and Michael Epstein’s “Once and For All” (closing night), about the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing.  “It is kind of natural for films about performers to wind up in those higher-profile slots,” Mr. Powers said. “They make a more natural fit than documentaries that perhaps are taking you to a darker place.”  “Miss Sharon Jones!,” about the lead singer of Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, and “Janis: Little Girl Blue,” about Janis Joplin, are among a cluster of films in the festival about female performers and artists. Among the others are Ron Nyswaner’s “She’s the Best Thing in It,” about the actress Mary Louise Wilson; Craig Lowy’s “OXD: One Extraordinary Day,” about the choreographer and dancer Elizabeth Streb; and Jack Walsh’s “Feelings Are Facts: The Life of Yvonne Rainer,” about the filmmaker and choreographer, all directed by men.  Asked whether her Joplin biography would have been different, had it been directed by a man, Ms. Berg said: “I think women look at women so differently than men look at women, obviously. I feel like for this personal and intimate a story, it helped that I was a female.”  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Janis: Little Girl Blue” makes extensive use of the plaintive, earnest, witty letters Joplin wrote to her conservative parents in Port Arthur, Tex., read in voice-over by Chan Marshall, the musician known as Cat Power. “I was very sensitive to her needs and desires that she was expressing in those letters to her parents,” Ms. Berg said. “I really do understand what she was going through. I remember being a teenager, and my parents were so terrified of the music I was listening to. Just the fear of what pop culture was going to do to my brain. And I understood that she was just trying to satisfy them but also follow her path, and she was so conflicted by that.”  Ms. Berg’s film, made for PBS’s “American Masters,” is a traditional, if particularly poignant, clips-and-interviews documentary about a subject who’s not around to speak for herself (though the device of the letters gives her a dominant voice in the film). Ms. Kopple’s film is a less conventional musical biography, largely concerning Ms. Jones’s battle with cancer while trying to hold together the funk-soul band the Dap-Kings, which she has fronted for 15 years.  “The first day of filming, the first time I had even met her, was the day they decided to cut her hair,” Ms. Kopple said. “It was an incredibly emotional moment to start getting to know somebody.”  Ms. Kopple had mixed feelings about whether a female director brought anything different to a film about a female performer. “I don’t know,” she said. “I have a sense of empathy, I have a sense of connection, and an understanding, maybe, that women share with one another. But I mean the film ‘Amy,’” about the singer Amy Winehouse, “was done extraordinarily well and that was done by a man. I think it’s how you connect with your subject.”  Noting that the question was “fraught with danger,” Mr. Powers answered anyway: “There’s an intimacy with Sharon Jones that it’s hard to imagine a male director having the equivalent of. And I think both films are notable for the real compassion that the directors have for their subjects. Maybe it’s a dangerous generalization to say that a woman director brings more compassion to their filmmaking than a male director does, but I can’t help but notice that.”  Looking at “Janis” and “Miss Sharon Jones!,” Ms. Berg concluded that the question of who made the movies was not the only issue. Choosing female subjects who are complex, and less than perfect, was crucial to changing the way Hollywood perceives women, she said.  “If we start portraying stronger, more flawed women, that will bleed into the rest of Hollywood,” she said. “It’s very rare to have a conflicted, flawed lead female in a big-budget feature. Sharon Jones and Janis Joplin, these are two very strong, conflicted women.”',1
'OBAMA APPLAUDS UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI PROTESTERS IN CALL FOR STUDENT ACTIVISM President Obama has praised the protesters whose stand against racism at the University of Missouri resulted this week in the resignation of the institution’s president and the announcement that its chancellor would step down at the end of the year.  Related: Mizzou Tigers score welcome win after week of racial tension and resignations  “I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst,” the president told ABC’s host George Stephanopoulos in an interview recorded on Thursday and broadcast, in part, on Sunday morning.  Staff from nine departments joined Mizzou student protesters in calling for college president Tim Wolfe and chancellor R Bowen Loftin to resign, over a lack of responsiveness to incidents of racial prejudice on and around campus.  In a move which attracted national attention, the school’s storied football team, with the support of its coaches, said it would not play until Wolfe resigned. One student went on hunger strike. Michael Sam, the Mizzou grad who became the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, attended some protests.    After Wolfe announced his resignation, the university appointed an African American administrator, Mike Middleton, as its interim president. Tensions on campus have not entirely dissipated.  Obama has previously praised the Black Lives Matter movement, which gained strength after the death last year of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager, at the hands of a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Columbia, the state capital where Mizzou is located, is only 100 miles or so away.  Speaking to ABC in the interview, the president added: “I want an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry, and the issue is just making sure that even as these young people are getting engaged, getting involved, speaking out, that they’re also listening.    “I’d rather see them err on the side of activism than being passive.  “The civil rights movement happened because there was civil disobedience,” he said, making a historical parallel to the Mizzou protests, “because people were willing to go to jail, because there were events like Bloody Sunday.  Related: How racial justice advocates took on Mizzou and won  “But it was also because the leadership of the movement consistently stayed open to the possibility of reconciliation and sought to understand the views – even views that were appalling to them – of the other side.  “You don’t have to be fearful of somebody spouting bad ideas. Just out-argue them. Beat them. Make the case as to why they’re wrong. Win over adherents.”  Obama said he encouraged his two daughters, Malia and Sasha, to make such arguments and to stand up against injustice where they found it.  “And, you know, I tell you, I trust Malia in an argument,” the president said. “If a knucklehead on a college campus starts talking about her, I guarantee you she will give as good as she gets.”',0
'MANHUNT UNDERWAY AS INVESTIGATION OF PARIS ATTACKS WIDENS PARIS — The Paris terrorist attacks were carried out with the help of three French brothers living in Belgium, the authorities said on Sunday, as they asked for the public’s help in finding one of them.          The French authorities said they were seeking Abdeslam Salah, 26, and described him as dangerous. The police warned the public: “Do not intervene on your own, under any circumstances.” Belgian officials said that his brother Ibrahim had died in the three-hour massacre on Friday night, which killed at least 132 people, and that another brother, Mohamed, was detained on Saturday in the Molenbeek area of Brussels.  The carefully coordinated attacks on Friday night, which President François Hollande says are the work of the Islamic State, increasingly appear to have involved extensive planning by a network of men with sophisticated weapons who plotted their attack from outside the country.  The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, after meeting in Paris with his Belgian counterpart, Jan Jambon, said the attackers had “prepared abroad and had mobilized a team of participants located on Belgian territory, and who may have benefited — the investigation will tell us more — from complicity in France.”  Continue reading the main story Latest Updates  French officials initially described eight attackers, but on Saturday night said that only seven had died — six by blowing themselves up and one in a shootout with police. They said on Sunday that they were looking for an eighth man believed to have been involved in the attacks. It was not immediately clear Sunday evening whether Mr. Salah was that eighth man.  Crucial, if sparse, details about four of the attackers came into view on Sunday.  One attacker — whose nationality is not yet known — evidently posed as a Syrian migrant. The Serbian newspaper Blic published a photograph of a passport page that identified its holder as Ahmad al-Mohammad, 25, a native of Idlib, Syria. He passed through the Greek island of Leros on Oct. 3 and the Serbian border town of Presevo on Oct. 7, officials in those countries said. It was not clear whether the passport was authentic; the civil war that has sent millions of Syrians fleeing and fueled the rise of the Islamic State has also created a large black market for forged Syrian passports.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At least three other attackers were French citizens. Two had been living in the Brussels area, including one in the community of Molenbeek, according to the Belgian authorities. The third was Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29, a native of Courcouronnes, France, who had been living in Chartres, 60 miles southwest of Paris, and who, along with two other gunmen, killed 89 people at the Bataclan concert hall.  Continue reading the main story Video  Mr. Mostefaï was the middle of five children born to an Algerian father and a Portuguese mother, and he once worked at a bakery, according to a former neighbor at the housing development just outside Chartres where the family used to live.  “It was a normal family, just like everybody else,” said the neighbor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “He played with my children. He never spoke about religion. He was normal. He had a joie de vivre. He laughed a lot.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Mostefaï changed. “It was in 2010, that’s when he started to become radicalized,” the neighbor said. “We don’t understand what happened.”  As the authorities continued to examine Mr. Mostefaï’s motivations and background, other clues emerged from official accounts in France and Belgium.  Continue reading the main story Video  Two vehicles used in the attacks had been rented in Belgium early last week, the federal prosecutor for Brussels announced on Sunday. One of them, a gray Volkswagen Polo, was abandoned near the Bataclan after being used by the three terrorists who died there.  The other, a black Seat Leon, was found early Sunday morning in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil. Three Kalashnikov rifles were found inside it. The vehicle may have been used as a getaway car for the shooters at restaurants in central Paris.  The Belgian authorities also announced that they had detained seven men. Three of them passed through a roadside check in Cambrai, France, at 9:10 a.m. Saturday, while on the A2 highway heading to Belgium. They made their way to Molenbeek, where the authorities detained them for unknown reasons and seized the car on Saturday afternoon.  Fundamental questions remained: how the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, managed to pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004, and whether they received direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West.  Continue reading the main story Video  The revelations that three of the attackers were French citizens were likely to exacerbate long-standing fears in France about the place of Muslim immigrants and converts in French society, 10 months after a smaller set of deadly attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, on a kosher grocery and against a police officer.  Mr. Mostefaï was one of three hostage-takers at the Bataclan, and was identified based on a print from his severed finger.  Mr. Mostefaï grew up around Chartres, where he lived until 2012. According to the Paris prosecutor, François Molins, he was arrested in connection with a series of low-level crimes from 2004 to 2010 and had been under surveillance since 2010, having been flagged in a French security services database as someone who had fallen under the influence of extremist Islamist beliefs. Six of his relatives have been detained for questioning; on Sunday, other relatives told French television that he had been estranged from them after a falling-out.  In his Facebook post, Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges of Chartres expressed despair and frustration. “How many deaths will occur before our political leaders understand and take action?” he asked, describing the “emotion, incomprehension and anger” he felt at the deaths.  Continue reading the main story Video  Mayor Gorges called for strong action, without asking questions first. “Our leaders don’t need to prove they are legitimate; we have elected them, so they take responsibility of the executive power of the republic,” he wrote on Facebook. “Their duty is to act effectively, and ultimately we don’t need to know how.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On Sunday, Mr. Hollande met his predecessor and political rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the Élysée Palace. Afterward, Mr. Sarkozy urged decisive action against the Islamic State — a position Mr. Hollande has also taken.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, is a steadfast ally of Syria’s embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, and recently began an aerial bombing campaign in Syria. The United States and France say the attacks have not been aimed at the Islamic State, as Mr. Putin claims, but at other groups opposing Mr. Assad.  Mr. Sarkozy, who has been known to be tough on immigrants during his tenure as president, cautioned against linking the refugee crisis with the terrorist attacks, but added: “We need, together, to rein in the wave of migration ensuing from the Syrian situation.”  As President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies gathered for a scheduled summit meeting in Antalya, Turkey, on the doorstep of the Syrian crisis, France’s president, François Hollande, stayed behind in Paris, his nation in mourning.  As the investigation proceeded, Mr. Obama told reporters in Turkey that the “skies have been darkened by the horrific attacks” in Paris and pledged that America would support France, its oldest ally. “We stand in solidarity with them in hunting down the perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justice,” Mr. Obama said after meeting with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the start of a 10-day trip that will also take him to the Philippines and Malaysia.  At the same summit meeting, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said there was no need for a complete review of the bloc’s refugee policy in response to the terrorist attacks.  “Those who organized, who perpetrated the attacks are the very same people who the refugees are fleeing and not the opposite,” Agence-France Presse quoted Mr. Juncker as saying. “And so there is no need for an overall review of the European policy on refugees.”  Pope Francis on Sunday deplored the terrorist attacks in Paris, which he described as an inconceivable “barbarity” and an “unspeakable affront to human dignity” that “leaves us shocked” and must be condemned.  “The path of violence and hatred does not solve the problems of humanity, and using the name of God to justify this path is blasphemy,” Francis told thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter’s Square for his weekly Angelus address.  “We wonder how the human heart can conceive and carry out such horrific events, which have shaken not only France but the whole world,” Francis said, before asking the faithful present to pray with him for the victims of the attacks.  Security measures at St. Peter’s, already significant, were increased on Sunday. The Italian government on Saturday said it would bolster surveillance of potential terrorist targets.',0
'EFFORTS TO REIN IN ARBITRATION COME UNDER WELL-FINANCED ATTACK Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A television ad during the Republican presidential debate last Tuesday depicted pale bureaucrats rubber-stamping the word “DENIED” on the files of frustrated Americans, beneath a red banner of Senator Elizabeth Warren evoking a Communist apparatchik.          The ad attacks the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created with Ms. Warren’s strong backing after the 2008 mortgage crisis. What the ad did not say: Its sponsor wants to rein in the agency in part because of its efforts to restrict arbitration — the widespread practice in corporate America of requiring customers and employees to resolve disputes not in the courts, but in private proceedings with neither judge nor jury. In fact, arbitration is one of the reasons the ad’s sponsor, American Action Network, wanted to blast the agency with the $500,000 campaign, the group said.  The consumer agency’s stance on arbitration, while difficult to convey in a TV spot, “is a perfect example of how government is taking away the power of individuals and handing it to the trial lawyers,” said Mike Shields, president of the American Action Network and a former top aide at the Republican National Committee.  Last week’s ad is one of multiple efforts across the country in recent weeks by both advocates and opponents of arbitration to revisit the much-debated practice, which, in two powerful decisions beginning in 2011, has been affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. The most significant moves came in Washington, where regulators, lawmakers and the Justice Department pushed for new restrictions on arbitration.  At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business lobby in the country, started a new effort to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by lobbying lawmakers to attach a rider to the federal budget bill that would force the regulator to conduct a new study before issuing any rule, according to people with direct knowledge of the strategy.  “If the Chamber of Commerce thinks they are going to slip a provision into a spending bill that cuts off consumer rights without a fight, they are very much mistaken,” Senator Warren said.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Matt Webb, a senior vice president of the chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform, called the bureau’s work “deeply flawed and incomplete.”  The flurry of activity follows the publication by The New York Times of a three-part series showing how corporations across the spectrum of the American economy — phone companies, credit card providers, nursing homes — use mandatory arbitration to circumvent the court system and derail legal claims alleging predatory lending, wage theft, discrimination and other violations. The reporting detailed how arbitration proceedings tend to favor businesses over individuals. In some instances, arbitration clauses require disputes to be settled in Christian arbitration, a process governed by the Bible rather than state or federal law.  Proponents of arbitration, who say it provides an efficient alternative to courts, view the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as among its biggest threats. They say a new rule proposed by the consumer agency, which would prevent financial services companies from including class-action bans in consumer contracts, could in effect kill arbitration altogether.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On Wednesday, the Justice Department issued a proposal to protect military service members from arbitration requirements. Earlier this month, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota and a longtime opponent of arbitration, renewed his push for Congress to pass a bill he introduced this year that would prevent companies from requiring employees to go to arbitration.  Several Democrats are expected to introduce bills intended to more widely curtail the use of arbitration clauses, according to the people. But with Congress deeply divided, some Democrats are calling on President Obama to use his executive authority to prevent federal contractors from including arbitration clauses in their contracts with customers and employees.  San Francisco’s city attorney, Dennis Herrera, sued American Express this month over what he claimed were “illegal and anti-competitive rules, policies and practices.” The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court, will probably help small businesses whose contracts with the credit card company prevented them from filing a class-action lawsuit.  Marina H. Norville, a spokeswoman for American Express, said, “We don’t believe the suit has merit,” adding that the company planned to “vigorously” defend itself against the lawsuit.  In Chicago, Alderman Edward M. Burke said he planned to introduce a bill this week that would prevent the city from doing business with companies that push employees and customers out of court. “It’s a way to get at a practice that is destroying a core American principle,” he said in an interview.  Arbitration has remained largely untouchable because of a pair of Supreme Court rulings in 2011 and 2013 that cleared the way for the use of class-action bans in contracts. With the current Supreme Court’s having now twice enshrined the wide use of arbitration, many opponents have pinned their hopes on the consumer agency’s proposed rule.  When the agency was created five years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal law overhauling the financial industry, it was given authority to study and craft rules to address arbitration. The agency’s research shows, among other things, that businesses have tended to get bigger awards than consumers in arbitration.  In 2010 and 2011, businesses won arbitration claims against consumers totaling $2.8 million, the findings showed, compared with awards to consumers totaling less than $400,000. The agency’s findings formed the basis for its proposed rule, which was released in draft form last month.  The Chamber of Commerce and others have said the agency’s findings do not support its proposed rules. “By ignoring its own data that clearly shows major deficiencies with court-based litigation and disregards the real-world advantages of arbitration, the C.F.P.B. has demonstrated its bias for trial lawyers over average Americans,” said Mr. Webb of the chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform.  Considerable sums of money are at stake. Late last month, the bond-rating firm Moody’s Investors Service warned that if enacted, the bureau’s proposed rule might leave companies more vulnerable to class actions that could “force changes to company practices that cut into revenues” or “draw regulatory scrutiny.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One reason arbitration advocates consider the bureau a significant threat is that it is empowered to issue rules without legislative approval, making them more difficult to defeat. Furthermore, unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is overseen by a bipartisan commission, the consumer agency has a single head appointed by the president.  At a legal summit hosted by the Chamber of Commerce late last month in Washington, participants spoke out forcefully against the consumer agency and its proposed arbitration rule. As attendees waited for one session to begin, Darth Vader’s theme song played on the sound system.  In his keynote speech on the virtues of free markets, John Stossel of the Fox Business Network lobbed a breast implant into the audience while discussing what he said was abusive litigation including lawsuits that involved claims of faulty implants. Mr. Stossel did not mention arbitration, but the subject came up during a session called Regulators Gone Rogue, in which a panelist cited the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s arbitration rule as an example of overreaching government oversight.  A chamber executive, introducing the panel, likened the chamber’s fight against regulations to the rebels’ revolt in the “Star Wars” movies. “Perhaps it is the real reason that Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie fought back against the evil empire,” he said.',0
'IN 8TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT RACE, SUPPORT FROM FEMALE VOTERS WILL BE KEY Maryland 8th Congressional District Democratic candidate Kathleen Matthews and fellow candidates took part in a forum sponsored by the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors in October. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  The words “woman” or “women” appear 11 times in the seven-paragraph biography on the campaign Web site of congressional hopeful Kathleen Matthews.  Women for Jamie, a group formed by state Sen. and fellow candidate Jamie Raskin, boasts more than 550 members, including Cecilia “Cissy” Suyat, wife of the late Thurgood Marshall, and state Senate colleagues Susan C. Lee and Karen S. Montgomery.  The seven Democratic candidates for Maryland’s 8th District seat know that women — especially those over 50 — are critical to their success in April’s primary.  More than 80 percent of Democrats in the district live in Montgomery County, where women accounted for 60 percent of Democratic primary voters in each of the past two presidential election years. The county has 17,000 “ultra Dems” — those who turned out for each of the past five Maryland primaries. Of them, 59 percent are women.  “The Democratic candidates have a choice. They can connect with women in the 50s-to-70s age groups on issues they care about. Or they can lose,” said Maryland Democratic consultant Adam Pagnucco.  He said the average age of women — and men — who voted in both the 2008 and 2012 Democratic primaries in the county was 63. Like women elsewhere in the state and across the county, they turn out at the polls in greater numbers than men. They also live longer, which extends their influence at the ballot box.  Many of these reliable female voters are retired or are winding down careers in which they confronted glass ceilings and other workplace challenges. They care about pay equity, abortion rights and paid family leave. They worry about their children or grandchildren running up debt to pay for higher education.  [Kathleen Matthews gets a spot on Emily’s List]  That’s why candidate Kumar Barve, a state delegate, mentions his work in the late 1980s as treasurer for the Maryland chapter of the abortion-rights group NARAL and his endorsement by Del. Anne R. Kaiser, a leader in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  And why former President Obama aide Will Jawando tells groups about his mother, who discovered after many years that she earned less than her male counterparts at a Silver Spring publishing company. In the White House, Jawando helped coordinate women’s and civil rights groups to support passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which strengthens protections against workplace discrimination.  On Tuesday evening, Matthews, Raskin, Barve, Jawando and the other Democratic 8th District contenders — Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez, David Anderson and Joel Rubin — will have a chance to make their case to women directly at a Bethesda forum sponsored by the Women’s Democratic Club of Montgomery County.  [Scrutiny over where money is coming from in Md. congressional race]  Bonnie Wicklund, 72, a retired librarian and ultra Dem from Chevy Chase, said she is undecided on the race and is likely to attend Tuesday’s forum. She is looking for “someone who is moderate, not an ideologue; has legislative experience; and will protect women’s health choices.” She said she wants Congress to find a way to address gun violence, although she is not optimistic that will happen.  Although Wicklund would like to see more women elected to national office, she said that won’t drive her decision. “Issues are more important to me than gender in this particular race,” she said.  Others see increasing the number of women in elected office as more of an imperative. Jane de Winter, 56, executive director of Big Learning, a nonprofit Silver Spring education program, supported former Montgomery County Council member Valerie Ervin for the congressional seat before she dropped out of the race.  De Winter said she knows little about Matthews, who had raised more money as of Sept. 30 than any other candidate. “But I feel obligated to look at her because women are underrepresented in Congress,” de Winter said.  [Valerie Ervin, citing money problems, exits 8th District race]  Some Montgomery political observers say that Matthews will benefit from the presence of two women at the top of the 2016 Democratic primary ballot: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Donna Edwards, who is running for the U.S. Senate nomination against Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the 8th District incumbent.  “Hillary is going to get a lot of women out to vote in the primary, and that will accrue to Donna and Kathleen’s benefit,” said Montgomery’s former county executive, Doug Duncan.  But that scenario depends in part on whether Clinton is in a heated race for the presidential nomination by the time the April 26 primary rolls around.  There are few substantive differences among the contenders on issues that resonate with older women. More important will be the candidates’ ability to convince female voters that they can be the most effective advocates for their positions.  Matthews, 62, a former Marriott executive and news anchor for WJLA (Channel 7), will use her robust campaign account to reach women and try to show them that her story — one of juggling career and kids — is their story.  In campaign ads, she calls Democrats the party that “stands up for working women.” She touts her support for requiring employers to pay for contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act, even if they have religious objections.  Raskin, 52, mixes policy with personal stories of the women in his life, including his wife, Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin.  At the “Women for Jamie” kickoff event in late September, he paid tribute to his late mother, the feminist writer Barbara Raskin, whose best-selling novel, “Hot Flashes,” chronicled three middle-aged women taking stock of their lives after a friend’s death.  Raskin will position himself as a women’s advocate with a legislative track record that includes major roles in the passage of marriage-equality legislation and the state’s version of the Ledbetter Act.  Sol Gutierrez, 73, is the only Hispanic in the race and the only woman besides Matthews. She said she will frame her appeal around immigration, with a focus on the estimated 28,000 Latino residents in District 8, which stretches into parts of Frederick and Carroll counties to the Pennsylvania border.  “Trump has woken us up,” she said.  Sol Gutierrez said she will also be trying to reach women at the senior end of the group, some of the most reliable voters.  “There’s such a huge emphasis on youth and the millennials and the young culture,” Sol Gutierrez said. “It’s wonderful to say this is our future, but it does not focus on what the needs of our seniors are.”',1
'BOSTON IS OFFERING FREE NEGOTIATION CLASSES TO EVERY WOMAN WHO WORKS IN THE CITY   In Boston, where women make 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, an effort is underway to train every working woman to better negotiate her salary. (Pablo Iglesias for The Washington Post)  BOSTON — Eleven women huddle in an aging community center, leafing through 27-page guides on how to negotiate pay. They speak of watching YouTube tutorials, of Googling market rates, of practicing at home with partners, of vowing not to cry at the office.  They’re part of America’s largest civic experiment to close the gender wage gap, launched this fall in Boston.  Women here earn 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, 4 cents higher than the national statistic. Disparities persist across age groups, industries and companies, researchers have found — even when colleagues of the opposite sex hold identical education levels and job titles.  That’s why Boston is offering free, two-hour salary negotiation classes to every woman who works in the city. They started in October, two years after former mayor Thomas Menino pledged that Boston would become the first U.S. city to achieve pay parity.  Think of it as an intimate conversation with 170,000 women.  Economists doubt the unprecedented approach will yield much of a difference, considering the social forces that exacerbate the gap. Also, a growing body of research suggests employers may be predisposed to respond negatively to women who request more.  City officials stress that Boston’s focus on equal pay is an economic imperative. The breadwinners in most local households with children, after all, are women. And since a raft of studies has shown that women don’t negotiate less skillfully, they simply negotiate less often, the central message of the program is: Give it a shot.  Tonight’s instructor is Megan Costello, executive director of Boston’s Office of Women’s Advancement. She asks the group to role-play. Some pretend to be employees, gunning for $66,000, and the rest act as bosses, offering up to $54,000.  The employees practice their pitches: I’m worth it, and here’s why.  “I get nervous even acting these scenarios out,” says Christy Betit, a woman with long chestnut hair who works in hospitality. “I can’t even pretend to ask for a raise without wanting to throw up.”  She takes a deep breath.  “Okay,” she says, “I’ve trained hundreds of students who have gone on to get great jobs. I studied theater, and I know how to engage a room.”  Remember, Costello tells them: You have power. A company’s search for new workers takes time and money. Smart managers try to hold on to the talent they have.  “And trust me,” she says, “every man does this. Every man negotiates.”  ‘It starts with leadership’  Boston’s feminist makeover reflects a strategy from its native Harvard Business School: Experiment until something works.  A decade ago, the university acknowledged its own gender equity crisis. In 2005, Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers ignited a public relations firestorm by suggesting at an economics conference that “innate” differences between women and men may explain the dearth of elite female scientists.  By 2007, business school leaders knew they had a gender problem after a third of junior women faculty members quit in a single school year. Female students who arrived with the same test scores as their male counterparts also appeared to disproportionately fall behind in class participation grades.  So professors took action. They recorded lectures, for example, to see if male students truly spoke up more than female students, a perception reflected in the grades. They found no significant difference in speaking frequency or comment quality, concluding the men simply sounded more authoritative. Assessed for substance over style, women saw better scores. The grade gap closed in 2011.  “Heightened consciousness among the faculty and students probably made the biggest difference,” said Robin Ely, an organizational behavior professor at the Harvard Business School. “It starts with leadership. There has to be support in terms of information and resources to help organizations take a look at their culture and understand how they operate.”  Boston’s mission has good intentions, she said, but the city should carefully consider its message. “The conversation should not be around women’s deficiencies, which is inaccurate,” Ely said, “or special treatment, which creates backlash.”  Conventional wisdom, the kind that climbs bestseller lists, suggests women in pay talks should be kinder, gentler, a team player.  “But the emphasis should be on the employer,” said economist Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “Women shouldn’t have to contort themselves into pretzels and go through all these social gyrations to be taken seriously.”  Boston wants to build a successful model for other major cities to adopt, said Costello, who oversees the salary negotiation program. “Legislation alone won’t fix things,” she said. “We need to change the culture to move the needle.”  Like professors making subjective calls on class participation, how employers respond to women asking for more pay also deserves serious attention, Costello said.  She warns students that bosses may discriminate against them, consciously or not, and emphasizes that such behavior isn’t legal. A tip from Page 25 of the guide: “Employers cannot make stereotypical comments about women and their work habits or make assumptions about the work habits of women with children.” It’s just one insight from the American Association of University Women, which designed and funded the Work Smart curriculum, intended to reach 85,000 women over five years.  The program is projected to cost up to $1.5 million, not including marketing and community outreach from the mayor’s office. Its teachers — city employees and local businesswomen — volunteer their time and personal anecdotes about wrangling more vacation days or, say, maternity leave.  The city’s collaboration with the AAUW started with Katharine Lusk, policy adviser to former mayor Menino, whose friend worked on the national nonprofit’s salary negotiation workshops. They wanted to make the training available on a mass scale and measure the results.  Lusk, who authored Boston’s 2013 report on its wage gap, said Menino was inspired by the pay equality advocacy of Evelyn Murphy, the state’s first female Lt. Governor, and research emerging from Harvard and other intellectual hubs across the country.  When Menino, the city’s longest serving mayor, stepped down in 2014 and died that year of cancer, his successor inherited the work and amplified it.  “We know that the wage gap continues to be an issue all across this nation, and it’s time to stop talking about it and start taking action,” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced at an entrepreneur’s conference in April.  To that point, Costello’s team at the mayor’s office is asking employers to sign a public declaration of their commitment to end the wage gap and submit anonymized salary data, to be published in a later report.  Such actions, she said, may make more hiring managers aware of any potential biases. Academic literature on the matter is particularly grim.  In a 2005 study, Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon and co-author of “Women Don’t Ask,” famously showed people videos of men and women asking for a raise, using the same words. Among male viewers, the men’s negotiating style won approval, while the women registered as too demanding.  These judgments, Babcock wrote, probably don’t happen on purpose. In some ways, that makes them harder to fend off, which is why some scholars advise business owners to entirely ban salary negotiations.  “People will think, ‘I’m not sexist’ or ‘I’m not racist,’ ” said Hannah Bowles, a public policy professor at Harvard University, “but certain biases can creep into their perceptions.”  She found in her research on gender differences in wage negotiations that simply telling managers that this form of discrimination exists might actually reinforce that such assumptions are acceptable.  “The surprising thing is,” Bowles said, “if you just tell employers the first part of the message, they actually internalize that it’s okay to judge people for breaking gender stereotypes.”  So, she said, it’s important to also say “our company doesn’t do that.”  Boston’s lesson plans don’t encourage women to embrace stereotypical femininity in pay talks. Its success rides on one persistent finding: Women will negotiate as much as men, even harder than men, if they receive social permission to do it.  Research shows when companies remove ambiguity from wage-setting, such as establishing clear pay ranges for workers at every level, disparities between the sexes start to disappear.  Labor economists at the University of Chicago found in a 2012 study when “salary negotiable” appears on a job listing, women negotiate more than men. The opposite was true, however, when the phrase vanished.    Maria Fernandes attended a workshop on negotiation in Boston. When her next performance review comes up, she says, she will ask for a raise. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  She'd asked for a raise, once  On a recent Tuesday, class meets in south Boston’s BCYF Holland Community Center, down the hall from an indoor swimming pool. A Spider Man poster on the wall shouts: Be your own hero.  Maria Fernandes, who works to connect low-income families with affordable housing at a national nonprofit group, learned about the training on Twitter. She saw an open invitation from mayor Marty Walsh.  Fernandes writes her age (33) and race (African American) on a form.  She’d asked for a raise, once. Her former boss at a local hospital declined, blaming a tight budget. Then, she heard, he found a little extra cash for her white, male colleague.  She quickly started looking for another job.  “My mom, an immigrant, always told me to keep my head down and work hard,” Fernandes says, shifting in a red plastic chair. “She said that would be enough. I know now it’s not enough.”  Economists say negotiation accounts for just a sliver of the gap. They also point to the disproportionate number of women in low-paying jobs and the time mothers spend out of the workforce with their children. Discrimination, they note, also plays a role.  For women of color, pay disparities tend to be much wider. Fernandes, whose family hails from Cape Verde, an island off Africa’s west coast, says her heritage adds another layer of complication.  “If I act aggressively,” Fernandes says, “they’ll see me as the Angry Black Woman. And no one wants that in their organization.”  Just before her seventh birthday, her family landed in a cramped apartment in Brockton, Mass. Her mother and sole guardian worked at a shoe factory, warning her five children, “If you ever act up, they’re going to send you away.”  Fernandes, a graduate of Clark University in Worcester, Mass., carried this mentality into the workplace. The fear has influenced the way she speaks (proper English, always) and wears her hair (rarely natural; blown out and shiny — the Michelle Obama look, she calls it).  “Your experience and background would be valuable to any employer,” Costello tells her, referencing a study that shows diversity in race and gender makes companies more profitable.  The other women nod.  When Fernandes started working at the nonprofit group last year, the role came with a slightly higher salary. She’s been documenting achievements, including the company event she organized without a hitch last month in Kentucky.  Her next performance review is three months away. She plans to ask for a raise.',1
'MASTERCHEF JUDGE TELLS FEMALE CONTESTANTS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN KITCHEN AND FAMILY It doesn’t, to borrow a well-known phrase from MasterChef, get much tougher than this. Or at least that is what chef, presenter and judge of MasterChef: The Professionals, Monica Galetti, would have aspiring female chefs believe.  She appears to have done her best to dampen the enthusiasm of any young woman minded to follow in her footsteps. Ahead of the launch of the new series of The Professionals on Tuesday, she told the Radio Times that women who were really serious about a successful career in a professional kitchen should probably think about putting off any thoughts of having a family – or possibly even a boyfriend.  “At a certain point, women have to decide how much they want their career versus having a family and spending time with family,” she said. “That’s it. There’s no BS about it – the truth is you’ve got to put it first to do well. I’ve seen many amazing chefs, girls, come into the kitchen and then give it up to be with their boyfriend. Would he do that for her?”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Monica Galetti with fellow judges of Masterchef: The Professionals, Gregg Wallace, left, and Marcus Wareing. Photograph: BBC/Shine  Related: Monica Galetti: 'When I first met Michel Roux I just thought he was mean'  But is Galetti right? The evidence would seem to suggest so, given the relatively small number of high-profile female chefs. Behind the glitz and the glamour of the professional cookery shows, it seems the industry is struggling to keep pace with the times. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that, while there are 250,000 professional chefs in the UK, only about a fifth of them are female.  But Emily Watkins, for one, is having none of Galetti’s negativity. The chef-patron of the Kingham Plough, an award-winning pub-restaurant in England’s Cotswolds, was back at work last week, two days after leaving hospital following the birth of her fourth child.  “Although there are times when my husband would say that I’ve put my job before my family,” she says, “I’m happy with my career. I don’t think I could put any more into it or take any more out of it. I always wanted to be a chef and I always wanted to be a mum, but the business was my baby and I’d never missed a serving.”  Watkins feels that Galetti’s words will do nothing to encourage women into an industry that is still dominated by men.  “What she said is a little off-putting to girls because it makes you feel that your family and your career are mutually exclusive. People need to have more confidence in the industry and realise that you’re not going to be repelled for being a woman. Good chefs are very scarce. The demand for good chefs is so fierce that it’s an employee’s world.”  For Watkins it wasn’t so much a question of balancing her career and her family as of the two colliding. She went into labour with her first childwhen she was at work, and with her second and third children she worked until the day before they were born.  “With this [fourth] one I was able to have a week off before giving birth,” she says. “I’ve got a bit more of a balance now, although there have definitely been hard moments when I’ve had calls from the childminder saying one of the kids has got a runny nose and I haven’t been able to go.”  Three hours drive north-west in the more remote reaches of the Isle of Anglesey, Claire Lara, the chefwho won MasterChef: The Professionals in 2010 and now works as head of food at The Oyster Catcher, Rhosneigr, points out the irony in the fact that, while some people are quick to suggest women should be in the kitchen, there are hardly any in professional ones. Lara, one of only two women to win the series, now has two young children, and moved to Anglesey partly to enable her to have a better work-life balance for her children.  “I was pregnant doing MasterChef but I didn’t realise,” she says. “I was feeling sick and stressed out, but I just put it down to Michel Roux Jr [a former presenter and chief judge on the show].”  Lara balances family and career with the help of her mother and her husband Marc, who also works at The Oyster Catcher as a sous chef. She says that, if women chefs do decide to have children, then it is better to make as much progress with their culinary career as they can before they take a break.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rachel Humphrey, head chef of Le Gavroche, London.  “I was fairly career-driven,” she says. “I’d just made a decision to put off having children. The better the position you have in the kitchen, the more flexibility you have. The older you get and the more experience you have in the kitchen the better.”  Many chefs point to the hard, physical work and the long hours as deterrents to advancement for female chefs. Others, such as Tom Kerridge, whose Hand and Flowers pub, in Marlow, Buckinghamsire, was awarded two Michelin stars, have suggested – much more controversially – that women don’t have the necessary “fire in the belly”.  Rachel Humphrey, head chef at Le Gavroche in London, says that she did choose to put her career first, but was aware of the consequences. “I made a choice to pursue my career when I was younger,” she says, the sound of the kitchen being cleaned between servings at Le Gavroche drowning out her voice as we speak. “I’m aware it’s a sacrifice I made, I’m not unhappy with it. When people I grew up with were meeting their future husbands and getting married, I was at work. I wouldn’t moan about it, that’s my choice.”  She acknowledges the long hours are problematric, but not just for women. “I’m here all the time. I leave home at seven in the morning and get back at half past midnight. If you do this job at this level, the hours are antisocial for everybody, for the lads and the girls.”  Marianne Lumb, owner and executive chef at Marianne in west London, is sympathetic to Galetti’s viewpoint: “To be any good in the kitchen you have to dedicate your life to it. You have to eat, breathe and sleep it, especially having your own restaurant. The hours are very long and to have a relationship is very difficult because the other person always has to come second. The more successful I’ve become, the more understanding men have been of that.”  She says that now, at the age of 40, if she were to have a baby she doesn’t think it would be fair on the child. “It’s the first time in my life that I’ve started to think about it. But I don’t get down about it, because I’m sure I was put on this Earth to cook.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marianne Lumb of Marianne’s in London  FEMALE CHEFS AT THE TOP  CLARE SMYTH  Head chef at Gordon Ramsay’s flagship Royal Hospital Road restaurant, Smyth is one of only three chefs in the UK – and the only woman – to hold three Michelin stars.

'MANY SAY HIGH DEDUCTIBLES MAKE THEIR HEALTH LAW INSURANCE ALL BUT USELESS Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  WASHINGTON — Obama administration officials, urging people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, have trumpeted the low premiums available on the law’s new marketplaces.          But for many consumers, the sticker shock is coming not on the front end, when they purchase the plans, but on the back end when they get sick: sky-high deductibles that are leaving some newly insured feeling nearly as vulnerable as they were before they had coverage.  “The deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it impossible to actually go to the doctor,” said David R. Reines, 60, of Jefferson Township, N.J., a former hardware salesman with chronic knee pain. “We have insurance, but can’t afford to use it.”  In many states, more than half the plans offered for sale through HealthCare.gov, the federal online marketplace, have a deductible of $3,000 or more, a New York Times review has found. Those deductibles are causing concern among Democrats — and some Republican detractors of the health law, who once pushed high-deductible health plans in the belief that consumers would be more cost-conscious if they had more of a financial stake or skin in the game.  “We could not afford the deductible,” said Kevin Fanning, 59, who lives in North Texas, near Wichita Falls. “Basically I was paying for insurance I could not afford to use.”  He dropped his policy.  As the health care law enters its third annual open enrollment period, premiums and subsidies have been one of the administration’s main selling points.  “Most Americans will find an option that costs less than $75 a month,” President Obama said.  Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, issued a report analyzing premiums in the 38 states that use HealthCare.gov. “Eight out of 10 returning consumers will be able to buy a plan with premiums less than $100 a month after tax credits,” she said.  But in interviews, a number of consumers made it clear that premiums were only one side of the affordability equation.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Our deductible is so high, we practically pay for all of our medical expenses out of pocket,” said Wendy Kaplan, 50, of Evanston, Ill. “So our policy is really there for emergencies only, and basic wellness appointments.”  Her family of four pays premiums of $1,200 a month for coverage with an annual deductible of $12,700.  In Miami, the median deductible, according to HealthCare.gov, is $5,000. (Half of the plans are above the median, and half below it.) In Jackson, Miss., the comparable figure is $5,500. In Chicago, the median deductible is $3,400. In Phoenix, it is $4,000; in Houston and Des Moines, $3,000.  Ms. Burwell said the administration had “seen high levels of satisfaction with the marketplace.”  And the marketplaces do vary. In Newark, some plans have no deductible, although the median deductible is $2,000, according to HealthCare.gov.  Health officials and insurance counselors cite several mitigating factors. All plans must cover preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies without a deductible or co-payment. Some plans may help pay for some items, like generic drugs or visits to a primary care doctor, before patients have met the deductible. Under the Affordable Care Act, health plans must have an overall limit on out-of-pocket costs, to protect people with serious illness against financial ruin.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In addition, people with particularly low incomes can obtain discounts known as cost-sharing reductions, which lower their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs if they choose midlevel silver plans. Consumer advocates say this assistance makes insurance a good bargain for people with annual incomes from 100 percent to 250 percent of the poverty level ($11,770 to $29,425 for an individual).  To those worried about high out-of-pocket costs, Dave Chandra, a policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, has some advice: “Everyone should come back to the marketplace and shop. You may get a better deal.”  But for many consumers, the frustration is real, as is the financial strain. In employer-sponsored health plans, deductibles have also been rising as companies shift costs to workers. Still, the average annual deductible in employer plans, $1,320 for individual coverage according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, is considerably less than the deductibles in many marketplace plans.  The Internal Revenue Service defines a high-deductible health plan as one with an annual deductible of at least $1,300 for individual coverage or $2,600 for family coverage.  Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University who supports the health law, said the rising deductibles were part of a trend that she described as the “degradation of health insurance.”  Insurers, she said, “designed plans with a hefty use of deductibles and cost-sharing in order to hold down premiums” for low- and moderate-income consumers shopping in the public marketplaces.  But the deductibles are so high they may be scaring away some consumers.  Alexis C. Phillips, 29, of Houston, is the kind of consumer federal officials would like to enroll this fall. But after reviewing the available plans, she said, she concluded: “The deductibles are ridiculously high. I will never be able to go over the deductible unless something catastrophic happened to me. I’m better off not purchasing that insurance and saving the money in case something bad happens.”  People who go without insurance next year may be subject to a penalty of $695 or about 2.5 percent of their household income, whichever is greater.  Karin Rosner, a 45-year-old commercial freelance writer who lives in the Bronx, pays about $300 a month, after a subsidy, for a silver insurance plan with a $1,750 deductible and a limit of $4,000 a year on out-of-pocket expenses.  She is extremely nearsighted and has an eye condition that puts her at risk for a detached retina, but has put off visits to a retina specialist because, she said, she would have to pay the entire cost out of pocket.  “While my premiums are affordable, the out-of-pocket expenses required to meet the deductible are not,” said Ms. Rosner, who makes about $30,000 a year.  Mr. Fanning, the North Texan, said he and his wife had a policy with a monthly premium of about $500 and an annual deductible of about $10,000 after taking account of financial assistance. Their income is about $32,000 a year.  The Fannings dropped the policy in July after he had a one-night hospital stay and she had tests for kidney problems, and the bills started to roll in.  Josie Gibb of Albuquerque pays about $400 a month in premiums, after subsidies, for a silver-level insurance plan with a deductible of $6,000. “The deductible,” she said, “is so high that I have to pay for everything all year — visits with a gynecologist, a dermatologist, all blood work, all tests. It’s really just a catastrophic policy.”  Another consumer, Anne Cornwell of Chattanooga, Tenn., said she was excited when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act because she had been uninsured for several years. She is glad that she and her husband now have insurance, because he has had tonsil cancer, heart problems and kidney stones this year.  But with a $10,000 deductible, it has still not been easy.  “When they said affordable, I thought they really meant affordable,” she said.',0
'NEW PASSPORT IN BRITAIN PUTS WOMEN IN 2ND CLASS Advertisement Continue reading the main story  LONDON — Britain’s newly designed passport was meant to celebrate the country’s creativity and innovation over the last five centuries, and officials have called it the “latest step in an evolutionary process” for passport security.          Activists and female politicians, however, say that the new travel document is a step backward because it features seven men but only two women.  The current passport, which is decorated with drawings of many birds but no humans, will be replaced next month by the new document, which the Home Office unveiled on Tuesday.  Called the “Creative United Kingdom” passport, it has been described as the most secure one that Britain has ever issued, with advanced technology using watermarks and ink that become visible only under infrared or ultraviolet light.  Stella Creasy, a Labour Party lawmaker whose successful campaign in 2013 to put Jane Austen on the 10 pound note was widely viewed as a victory for gender equality and female representation, could barely contain her disbelief.  Photo  “So tired of this shizzle — home office could only find 2 UK women 2 celebrate in 500 years of history #tellHERstory,” she wrote on Twitter.  Emily Thornberry, another lawmaker and a former attorney general in the shadow cabinet of Ed Miliband, told the BBC that the new passport was “quite exasperating.”  It is an “opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women,” she said. “We have had this fight about bank notes, and now it’s about passports. I just feel as though we are here all over again.”  Elisabeth Scott, the architect of the Royal Shakespeare Theater in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, Shakespeare’s birthplace, is on one of the passport’s 34 pages. The other woman featured is Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician considered to be one of the first computer programmers. She is known for her work with Charles Babbage, a pioneer of computer science who is also honored in the new passport.  The six others on the passport are Shakespeare; the painter John Constable; John Harrison, who invented the marine chronometer; the architect Giles Gilbert Scott; and the sculptors Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor.  James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, defended the new document, saying that images had been chosen “in homage to the successes in innovation, architecture, arts and performance.”  The new passport, he said, “is the latest step in an evolutionary process that began even before the time of Shakespeare, with a simple scroll of parchment being issued as the first passport in 1378.”  Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office, which revealed the document at Shakespeare’s Globe, a theater in London, said that it “wasn’t something where we set out to only have two women.”  He said that officials “tried to get a range of locations, a range of things around the country, and to celebrate our triumphs and icons over the years.”  “So there we are,” he added.  When pressed about why the authors Jane Austen or the Brontë sisters had not been included, Mr. Thomson said it was inevitable that some influential figures would not make the cut.  “Whenever you do these things, there is always someone who wants their favorite rock band or their local icon or something else in the book,” Mr. Thomson said.  It did not escape notice that none of the nine people honored in the new passport are from Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, although the travel document does feature landscapes from Scotland, including Edinburgh Castle.  “Let’s not lose sight of the fact that today is about launching one of the most secure documents in the world,” Mr. Thomson later told the newspaper The Independent. “So the fact that we’re also using the opportunity to celebrate creativity is really good, really nice, but fundamentally it’s about making sure this is a very secure document.”',1
'INSIDE TRUMP’S PALM BEACH CASTLE AND HIS 30-YEAR FIGHT TO WIN OVER THE LOCALS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump purchased this 128-room Palm Beach mansion in 1985 for a bargain price and turned it into a private club. But the mansion has brought Trump some controversy in the sunny Florida city. (Rosalind S. Helderman, Mary Jordan and Victoria M.

But the mansion has brought Trump some controversy in the sunny Florida city. (Rosalind S. Helderman, Mary Jordan and Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post)  The patriarchs of this quiet island of millionaires threw up roadblocks when Donald Trump swooped in and turned its historic oceanfront Mar-a-Lago mansion into a private club.  The town council, seeing Trump as an ostentatious outsider, handed him a list of restrictions as he sought to transform the property in the 1990s. Membership, traffic, party attendance, even photography — all would be strictly limited.  But Trump undercut his adversaries with a searing attack, claiming that local officials seemed to accept the established private clubs in town that had excluded Jews and blacks while imposing tough rules on his inclusive one.  Trump’s lawyer sent every member of the town council copies of two classic movies about discrimination: “A Gentleman’s Agreement,” about a journalist who pretends to be Jewish to expose anti-Semitism, and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” about a white couple’s reaction to their daughter bringing home a black fiance.  The move infuriated council members, who said it was a distraction from their concerns that Trump’s club would spoil a quiet street. But, in time, Trump got most of the restrictions lifted.  1 of 17 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump’s Florida estate View Photos Donald Trump has turned his Palm Beach estate Mar-a-Lago into a private club.

Trump’s relationship with Palm Beach, where he has spent three decades brawling with local officials and winning over many, was an early indicator of the personality traits and tactics that have helped propel him to the top of Republican presidential primary polls.  In buying and then winning the right to transform the landmark property, Trump demonstrated how he gains leverage by exposing and exploiting the weaknesses of his opponents, combining bombast with a willingness to compromise, and casting every outcome as a resounding Trump victory.  [Donald Trump begs Iowans not to believe Ben Carson: ‘Don’t be fools, okay?’]  The story of Trump’s ownership with Mar-a-Lago is also a reminder of the real estate mogul’s tabloid past — a time, long before he began courting conservative voters, when he reveled in extravagant parties, beautiful women and celebrity friendships.  Many in Palm Beach today recoil at his look-at-me ego and are appalled at his frequent displays of unfiltered Trump, like emblazoning his name on a coat of arms on Mar-a-Lago’s elegant facade.  “It’s all about the Trumpster,” said Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce. “I would venture to think that old Palm Beach doesn’t . . . consider him one of their own.”  The tiled patio at Mar-a-Lago, a focal point of the estate. ( Mary Jordan/The Washington Post)  But, just as Trump has forced many in the national Republican establishment to accept him as an enduring presence in this year’s presidential campaign, Trump and his club have become undeniable cornerstones of Palm Beach society.  “Whether they love me or not, everyone agrees the greatest and most important place in Palm Beach is Mar-a-Lago,” Trump boasted in a recent interview. “I took this ultimate place and made it incredible and opened it, essentially, to the people of Palm Beach. The fact that I owned it made it a lot easier to get along with the Palm Beach establishment.”  Trump, who points on the campaign trail to his lack of political experience as a plus, said voters should consider his record with Mar-a-Lago as evidence that he could be a strong commander-in-chief. His Palm Beach dealings, he said, offer a lesson on how the United States, “should be negotiating with Iran, with China, with India and with Japan and everybody else.”  The host with the most  The property today, encompassing more than 17 acres on this narrow, 16-mile-long island, operates in two money-making ways. It is a private club, open to members who pay a $100,000 initiation fee plus annual dues of $14,000, and a venue that can be rented for weddings and events. Trump brags that Mar-a-Lago hosts superior events to another iconic Palm Beach property, the century-old Breakers Hotel, which he said “gets the leftovers.”  Last year, Trump made $15.6 million from Mar-a-Lago, according to financial disclosures Trump filed as part of his presidential campaign.  Trump closes off part of the main house for his private quarters. The name of Trump’s late mother, Mary Trump, who grew up in a modest house in Scotland, appears over the door to the room where she often stayed. Another room is dominated by an elaborate canopied bed where Trump’s daughters Ivanka and Tiffany slept as children.  Many of Trump’s rivals in the presidential race have been to Mar-a-Lago for functions, including Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. So have many Republican commentators, including Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham.  Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton came, too, attending Trump’s wedding to Melania Knauss 10 years ago.  [Meet Melania Trump, a new model for first lady]  Since 2013, the Palm Beach County Republican Committee has held its annual Lincoln Day fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. Michael Barnett, committee chairman, remembers seeing Cruz last year deep in conversation with Trump and wonders if one of the reasons they are so friendly on the campaign trail is because of a bond forged at Mar-a-Lago.  Until he hit the presidential campaign trail, Trump spent many weekends at Mar-a-Lago, hopping table to table asking diners if they tried his mother’s meatloaf on the menu or enjoyed his ocean view. Trump, whose brother died of alcoholism, does not drink. Friends say his relaxation comes from golf and presiding over Mar-a-Lago, chatting with guests.  He lets Palm Beachers come to him, rarely venturing out to shops and restaurants in town.  “I do get along with people,” Trump said. “You have everybody there. You have people from the Middle East. You have Jewish people. I mean, you have Jewish people having dinner with people from the Middle East. You have Christians. You have old-line WASPs.”  The winter White House  Mar-a-Lago was opened in 1927 as a private estate by one of the richest women in the world, Marjorie Merriweather Post.  She donated her 128-room home to the U.S. government in 1973 for use as the winter White House. But under President Jimmy Carter, the government turned the property over to the private Post Foundation, saying it was too expensive to maintain.  Trump wanted it to be his.  So, according to Trump, when his first offer of $28 million was turned down, he decided to play hardball. He said he bought the beachfront property directly in front of it through a third party and threatened to put up a hideous home to block its ocean view, he recalled in the interview.  “That was my first wall,” he said. “That drove everybody nuts. They couldn’t sell the big house because I owned the beach, so the price kept going down and down.”  In the end, Trump bought the landmark in 1985 for a bargain, paying $5 million for the house and $3 million for Post’s antiques and lavish furnishings.  From the start, Trump’s approach stood out in Palm Beach, a small town whose cloistered estates and private beaches appealed to the super rich seeking to live quietly.  Along with old-money families with homes here since the Gilded Age, there are billionaires with more money than Trump who drive their Bentleys into estates hidden behind high hedges.  Trump had Mar-a-Lago’s hedge on South Ocean Drive chopped down to ensure passersby could see his castle.  He has invited high-profile guests such as Michael Jackson to stay overnight, drawing paparazzi. He was chided in local papers for floating the rumor that Princess Diana, Madonna and other big names were joining his club, a promoter’s tactic to build buzz.  Over time, he added a Louis XIV-style ballroom with 40-foot ceilings and $7 million worth of gold leaf on its walls. He spent $100,000 on four gold-plated bathroom sinks near the ballroom.  “It’s become part of the fabric of the social life of Palm Beach,” said Jane Day, who as the town’s historic preservation consultant at times clashed with Trump. But like many, she credited Trump with saving the historic home and managing it in a way that has allowed many people to enjoy it.  The property employs scores of waiters, landscapers, cooks and other staff, including foreign workers brought in using special visas. Trump’s reliance on immigrant labor has received attention in recent months as he has made illegal immigration a signature issue on the campaign trail.  An open invitation  Trump made Mar-a-Lago appealing even to his biggest skeptics. He brought in headliners including Elton John, Celine Dion, Diana Ross, Luciano Pavaratti and Jay Leno, who performed at charity balls and events open to anyone who could afford a ticket.  By opening access, Trump sought to dull opposition to him.  Trump urged officials to become members, including those he was feuding with.  For a time, McDonald, the former mayor, was even doubles partners at the club with Marla Maples, Trump’s second wife.  Trump invited the historic preservation society arguing with him over alterations to the landmark to hold its annual luncheon there. And the town police, summoned if a party grew too noisy, now hold their annual benefit there. Police records show officers often have stopped at the mansion for coffee and meal breaks.  Allen Wyett, a frequent Trump critic, recalled that the morning after Wyett’s election to the town council in 1995, he received a phone call from Trump, who wanted to personally invite him to a show at Mar-a-Lago. Wyett declined and never joined Mar-a-Lago. But he said the invitations continued to concerts, to comedy shows.  Wyett, who is Jewish, said he would hear Trump talk with pride about Mar-a-Lago’s nondiscriminatory policy, but wondered if it was a business strategy: “Was he smart enough to realize that Palm Beach is about 40 percent Jewish and he was not going to attract the old guard anyway?”  Outrageous and effective  Mar-a-Lago became a party destination in the late 1990s, particularly after Trump split from Maples and before he married Knauss. Rich men mingled with the models and beauty pageant contestants who always seemed to be floating around his tiled patio.  “It was 3-to-2, beautiful women-to-men,” recalled Roger Stone, a former adviser to Trump.  “That’s true,” Trump, laughed, stressing he was single at the time. “The point was to have fun. It was wild.”  In 1998, Trump invited Sean Combs, the rapper then known as Puff Daddy. But Combs scandalized Palm Beach when he was caught on a beach in the “middle of his midnight romp with a long-legged stunner,” according to the Page Six account in the New York Post.  Even as Mar-a-Lago became more established, Trump’s battles with local officials never really ended.  Wyett and other council members said the town’s fights with Trump typically boiled down to Palm Beach trying to apply rules designed to protect a residential neighborhood. In their view, Trump doesn’t believe rules apply to him. But they said his unconventional tactics have often worked.  “He can be outrageous.” said Wyett. “He can be as gentle as a kid. He can be gracious. He can be as vindictive as anyone you’ve ever met. He’s everything wrapped into one package with a ribbon on it.”  Flags and planes overhead  Palm Beach has a lot of rules: No whistling allowed on public streets after midnight. No “Missing Dog” — or any sign — posted on a tree. And no flag poles taller than 42 feet.  In late 2006 Trump put up a giant American flag on an 80-foot pole. That led to a $1,250-a-day fine against him, drawing national headlines that Trump basked in.  “Tonight, Donald Trump does legal battle again, this time with a bunch of millionaires down in Palm Beach, Florida, who told Trump he’s flying his flag too high,” is how Nancy Grace started her CNN interview in January 2007 with Trump. “Can you fly the American flag too high?” she asked.  Trump got fan mail as he said in a blizzard of interviews: “No American should have to get a permit to fly the flag.”  “I said, ‘This is a dream to have someone sue me to take down the American flag,’ ” Trump said in the interview.  Trump sued Palm Beach for $25 million in damages, arguing the flag was constitutionally protected free speech.  Ultimately, Trump reached a settlement with the town. He would put a slightly smaller flag farther from the road and mount it on a 70-foot pole.  Instead of paying any fines, Trump made a $100,000 donation to a veterans charity.  When he was mayor, McDonald, a military veteran, said he “got heartburn” as Trump used a little town regulation to shower himself with “$100 million in free publicity.”  While gracious to many neighbors, Trump has mocked others.  He famously called actress Dina Merrill, the daughter of Mar-a-Lago founder Marjorie Merriweather Post, “arrogant and aloof.” In his book “The Art of the Comeback,” he said she was working against his plans for the estate and that she had been “born with her mother’s beauty but not her brains.” He called a civic leader who opposed his efforts a “loser.”  He has filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits as casually as others file their nails. It’s a Trump strategy, critics say, to wear people out and get what he wants.  Trump has filed three lawsuits over perhaps his biggest irritation: the planes that fly over Mar-a-Lago, which sits just a couple miles from the West Palm Beach airport’s main runway.  A judge is now weighing a $100 million lawsuit Trump filed in January, arguing that airport director Bruce Pelly — who Trump has called “a moron” — has engaged in a “deliberate and malicious” effort to direct the planes over his home.  Pelly and a county attorney declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. In court, the county has argued that the Federal Aviation Administration traffic controllers determine airplane flight paths, not Pelly.  The suit, they argued in court, appeared designed to “create press buzz for Trump’s announced presidential campaign, cocktail party braggadocio and negotiating leverage.”  In his first lawsuit involving the airport, Trump won no money and the planes continued to fly over Mar-a-Lago. But Palm Beach County agreed to try to limit noise and said it would lease a 215-acre parcel of airport-owned land to Trump. That land is now the Trump International Golf Course West Palm, where, according to federal filings, Trump made $12.7 million last year.  “There was a lot of strategy in it. You have to admire him for it,” McDonald said.  People in town now speculate Trump might have finally found a way to clear the sky above.  If elected president and the house becomes the winter White House as the original owner intended, the Secret Service could order a no-fly zone.',0
'THE DEMISE OF WOMEN'S CHARITY EAVES SHOULD WORRY US ALL In 1987 I found myself homeless, having moved to London from Leeds, and was directed to Eaves (then known as Homeless Action), a charity set up a decade earlier that provided homes for single, low-income women. I was given a room in a terraced house in Peckham, which I shared with five other women, some of whom were homeless as a result of sexual violence. I would see the support workers come over to take care of these vulnerable women, and was impressed at how much difference it made to their daily lives.  Last week I sat at my desk in Eaves for Women, and watched the staff clear out their desks. The funding had gone and the charity had no choice but to go into administration.  Eaves will leave behind the 1,000 or so service users who access the charity every year, asking for support, advocacy, or long-term social work. Eaves was unique in that ,since it appointed the formidable Denise Marshall in 2000 as its chief executive, it combined direct support to women who had experienced a wide range of male violence and abuse, with campaigning, lobbying, research, policy, and peer-support programmes in which service users could go on to volunteer to work with other vulnerable women.  I have been a research consultant for Eaves since 2004, and was a friend of Marshall, who died in August. But even putting aside my personal ties to the organisation, it’s clear to see how this cruel and ruthless government is slashing women’s services and expecting them delivered on the cheap; increasingly, women’s charities are being given less money to see the same number of women, and are expected to cut the quality of the services. In order to be competitive when applying for local or central government grants the costs for core services, such as rent and administrative support, are often undercut to the point where it was almost impossible to run an office.  Marshall refused to put costs above quality. Having seen other women’s charities being taken over by generic organisations which then paid the staff less and provided poorer services to abused women, Marshall was having none of it. In 2011, she returned her OBE in protest at government cuts.  “As a feminist organisation, you have to deliver your services in that context in order to change things in the long term,” says Karen Ingala Smith, the director of the NIA Project and former employee of Eaves. “This government is only interested in delivering the bare minimum to women and girls because of its own massive budget cuts.”  Eaves had been in financial difficulty since 2010. In 2011, the Home Office gave Eaves a total of £4m to run two essential services – one, the Poppy Project, which houses and supports women trafficked into the UK, and the Scarlett Centre, a drop-in support centre for women that provided support to seek work or education. The following year, Eaves received nothing. The government grant to support trafficked women went to the Salvation Army, which had submitted an application for considerably less funding and a pared-down service, and Scarlett was closed for good.  We need to get back on to the streets to protest these savage cuts to the women’s sector, and make sure everyone knows that all woman can be a step away from needing the type of support Eaves provided. Are women’s lives really that worthless?',1
'US SUPREME COURT TO HEAR BIGGEST ABORTION RIGHTS CASE IN TWO DECADES The US supreme court has agreed to hear a challenge to one of the nation’s harshest abortion laws in what could be the most consequential case on abortion rights the court has taken in 23 years.  The law, known as HB2, is a Texas measure passed in 2013 that has since led to the closure of more than half the state’s abortion clinics. Out of the hundreds of new abortion restrictions lawmakers have passed since 2010, few have had such a profound impact on abortion access in a single state.  Related: It's not just Texas: abortion clinics are rapidly closing in liberal states, too  “This law is causing real harm to women across the state of Texas,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder of Whole Woman’s Health, a network of abortion clinics with four locations in Texas. “We have been fighting this draconian law since 2013 … I am hopeful that the supreme court will uphold the rights that have been in place for four decades and reaffirm that every woman should be able to make her own decision about continuing or ending a pregnancy.”  Whole Woman’s Health is one of several providers suing to overturn the law.  Before the law began to take effect, Texas had 41 abortion clinics. A provision requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges with a hospital cut that number in half, and there are 18 clinics today. A second provision of the law, which has been blocked on and off for two years, would further slash the number of providers to nine or 10. That provision mandates that all abortion clinics comply with hospital-like “ambulatory surgical center” standards, which are too expensive for most abortion providers to meet.  The stakes of the case are enormous. Texas abortion providers are challenging the supreme court to declare how far states can go in restricting abortion ostensibly to protect women’s health, which the court has never fully clarified.  In a 1992 case, Planned Parenthood v Casey, the supreme court gave states the right to restrict abortion in the interest of the woman’s health as long as the restriction is not an “undue burden”. But the court has never defined what the term means.  Abortion foes contend that a law is not an undue burden unless it takes a major toll on abortion access, while abortion rights advocates argue that a law is an undue burden if it serves no actual medical purpose. Which argument prevails could make the difference between a tidal wave of anti-abortion bills and a trickle. Conservative state lawmakers have enacted hundreds of new abortion restrictions in the past five years that mainstream medical organizations say carry no real health benefits.  “I don’t think it’s overstating the case to say if the court upholds the restrictions based on the justifications each state is offering – that these are health protective – that it would result in the most drastic reduction of the availability of abortion at any point since Roe v Wade,” Priscilla Smith, director of Yale Law School’s reproductive justice program, said last week.  Related: The biggest US city without an abortion clinic: El Paso's sole facility faces closure  A sweeping opinion on the Texas law would have immediate consequences for abortion clinics in seven other states. Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin have all passed similar laws, now mired in legal battles, which could close a combined 20 abortion clinics. Several of those states would be left with just one or two abortion providers.  A favorable ruling for abortion foes could also drive new restrictions. “If the supreme court gives the thumbs-up to these types of regulations, you will see other states follow,” said Denise Burke, vice-president of legal affairs of Americans United for Life, which supported the Texas measure. Other anti-abortion proposals, such as those restricting when and where women may use medication to end their pregnancies, may also benefit from a ruling for Texas or Mississippi.  The court on Friday did not say whether it would hear another appeal from Mississippi to enforce a harsh 2012 abortion measure. The case presents a similar constitutional question, and could be addressed by a broad ruling in the Texas case.  The Mississippi law required physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, which the state touted as a safety measure. Abortion foes derided the measure as unnecessary for patient safety and a poorly disguised attempt to shut down the state’s only clinic, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization.  Under the law, Mississippi would have become the first state without a single abortion provider since the court established the right to abortion in Roe v Wade almost 43 years ago. The fifth circuit court of appeals blocked that law in 2014.  A three-panel judge drawn from the same circuit upheld the Texas law in June. The court’s four liberal justices plus justice Anthony Kennedy temporarily blocked that decision from going into effect and closing down all but nine or 10 Texas abortion clinics. The abortion providers appealed to the supreme court in early September.  Abortion rights advocates argue that ambulatory surgical center and admitting privilege requirements are not necessary to perform safe abortions and do not make abortion safer. They see ASCs, which can cost an abortion provider millions of dollars to build and maintain, as a way of putting abortion providers out of business.  “ASC and privileges requirements do nothing to protect the health and safety of women and are incongruous with modern medical practice,” read a brief submitted to the fifth circuit by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association. “Scientific literature suggests that the safety of abortions performed in an office setting is equivalent to the safety of those performed in a hospital setting … HB2’s requirement that abortion facilities meet the standards for ASCs is devoid of any medical or scientific purpose.”  The brief noted that most abortions are simple procedures, with no incisions, and the risk of death from abortion is 0.0006%, while only 0.05%-0.2% of abortion procedures involve major complications.  Texas is a state with 5.4 million women of reproductive age. With only a handful of clinics left, researchers have estimated that nearly 2 million women would live more than 50 miles from the nearest abortion clinic. Three-quarters of a million women would live more than 200 miles away. And because wait times for an abortion would skyrocket, the number of second-trimester procedures, which are more expensive, invasive and time-intensive, could double.',1
'LURED IN BY TWO MANHATTAN PSYCHICS, TO THE TUNE OF $718,000 Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He sat in a Denny’s restaurant, drinking coffee between cigarette breaks after a long and sleepless night, answering question after question.          He knew none of it made sense: He was a successful and well-traveled professional, with close to seven figures in the bank, and plans for much more. And then he gave it all away, more than $718,000, in chunks at a time, to two Manhattan psychics.  They vowed to reunite him with the woman he loved. Even after it was discovered that she was dead. There was the 80-mile bridge made of gold, the reincarnation portal.  “I just got sucked in,” the man, Niall Rice, said in a telephone interview last week from Los Angeles. “That’s what people don’t understand. ‘How can you fall for it?’ ”  There was even, between payments to one of the psychics for a time machine to cleanse the past, a brief romance.  “It’s embarrassing now,” he said.  In May, the police arrested one of the psychics, Priscilla Kelly Delmaro, 26, after Mr. Rice sought out a private investigator and decided to press charges. She was charged with grand larceny.  The man’s identity was not revealed in court documents. But Mr. Rice, a 33-year-old British consultant, said he chose to come forward last week, after learning that the Manhattan district attorney’s office intended to allow Ms. Delmaro to plead guilty in exchange for a year in jail, and that it was unlikely that he would ever see any restitution. A hearing is set for Tuesday.  “I just want justice,” Mr. Rice said from Los Angeles, where he now lives. “I just don’t want her to do to anyone else what happened to me.”  It seems almost unfathomable that anyone could be taken in so thoroughly, with such a breathtaking level of gullibility. And so, Mr. Rice’s story begins.  By the spring of 2013, he had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in search engine optimization, drawing traffic to websites in exchange for commissions. He was raised in a poor family, and planned to buy his mother a house in England.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But he was troubled. Painfully uncomfortable in social settings, he drank heavily and used drugs, he said. That year, he flew from England to Arizona to enter a rehabilitation clinic for acute anxiety, he said. In the clinic, he met a woman named Michelle, another patient.  “We had such a strong connection, it was unbelievable,” he said. “I loved her deeply.”  But the relationship ended a couple of weeks after they left rehab, when Michelle overdosed on pills and returned to the clinic. She broke it off with Mr. Rice. He said he agreed it was for the best.  Photo  “I was moving on with my life,” he said. He came to New York and found a bed in the McKibbin lofts in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, two former warehouses filled with makeshift apartments that are often likened to a rowdy dormitory for young newcomers.  Depressed one day in August, he walked over the Williamsburg Bridge to Manhattan and spotted a psychic shop on Delancey Street. “And I went in,” he said. (In a previous written statement to the police about this day, Mr. Rice claimed to have visited a psychic in Times Square. In fact, he said on Thursday, he was on Delancey. His Times Square encounter was still two months away.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He met a psychic named Brandy. “She knew a lot of stuff,” he said. Stuff about him. “ ‘I saw that you were connected to this girl,’ ” she told him.  He told her about Michelle. “She said, ‘If you could choose, would you want to be back with her?’ ” he said.  Yes.  She asked for $2,500 that day, and he withdrew it from a nearby Chase bank. She said he would have his money back soon.  “I ended up giving her 10 grand, 12 grand in the first week,” he said. “It’s hard to explain.”  He continued. “It wasn’t like saying, ‘Give me 10 grand and I’ll tie your shoelaces,’ ” he said. “There’s a half truth in there, there’s something in it. This whole psychic scam is based on them knowing what’s going on in your life. They have a gift.”  He bought a $40,000 ring from Tiffany’s for Brandy to ward off evil spirits. He spent his birthday with her and her family, and they cooked him a steak. But he lost faith in her. He had recently visited Michelle in California, a disastrous five-minute conversation on the sidewalk. “The whole way I was caught up in it, she said afterward I was acting weird,” he said.  So he shopped around for a new psychic. He drove to work in Midtown Manhattan and parked his car in a garage near Times Square, on West 43rd Street. He noticed a psychic parlor across the street. There, he met Ms. Delmaro, who called herself Christina, Mr. Rice said.  “She somehow said all the right things,” he said. “It sounds mad now that I’m saying it.”  He led a double life. “I’d go to Christina and talk about Michelle for an hour, and go back to the office. She wouldn’t leave me alone. She was like family.” He paused and added, “I needed my mum, really.”  He kept his visits to the psychics largely to himself, but eventually mentioned Christina to a roommate at McKibbin, Lauren Horton.  “He seemed like a normal guy,” Ms. Horton, 34, a graphic designer, said Friday. But his faith in Christina, and the money he was paying her, was something else altogether.  “It was insane to me,” Ms. Horton said. “I told him many times he was out of his mind. He was convinced that if he didn’t pay her for the work she was doing for him, bad things would happen to him.” She likened his continued visits to the psychic to an addiction.  Mr. Rice moved out of East Williamsburg to an apartment on the Lower East Side, and invited Ms. Horton over for Christmas. Christina was there. “I didn’t like her because I knew what was going on,” Ms. Horton said.  In February 2014, Mr. Rice, longing to see Michelle, logged on to her Facebook page.  “I saw, ‘R.I.P.,’ ” he said. Michelle had died of a drug overdose.  Mr. Rice said he had just paid Christina $90,000 that she said was needed to build a bridge of gold in another dimension to trick an evil spirit that was haunting Michelle. He called her and told her Michelle was dead.  “Christina said, ‘Don’t believe it,’ ” he said. “ ‘If you believe it, it’s true.’ ”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  She said she could help get Michelle back — a reincarnated Michelle, a new Michelle.  Then things escalated.  “I slept with Christina,” Mr. Rice said. “We slept together once. It was a massive mistake.”  Ms. Delmaro’s lawyer, Jeffrey Cylkowski, said the relationship throws his accusations of theft into question. “If you’re involved with somebody, was it a gift?” he said.  Mr. Rice left New York and moved to California, where he had briefly lived. He said Christina emailed him constantly about visions she had of a new Michelle: “ ‘I just saw someone in the supermarket; it might have been her.’ ”  There was one last giant payment — “the big one” — for $100,000, he said. His bank asked him to confirm what he was spending the money on. A car, he said.  Christina told him she was broke because she had no time for other clients. “She was homeless, she’d lost everything for me,” Mr. Rice recalled being told. “I believed she lived in a church.”  He met and dated a woman who Christina led him to believe was the new Michelle. He questioned her, looking for common traits — “I was being weird” — and the relationship ended.  He flew back to New York and met a private investigator who identified Christina as Ms. Delmaro, who had been arrested previously in Florida. Mr. Rice pressed charges in May, giving the police bank records showing the payments.  He later acknowledged that his statements were incomplete: He accused Ms. Delmaro of taking all his money, leaving out the two months he spent consulting with the other psychic, Brandy, because he had resumed contact with her and now believed she was protecting him from possible retaliation, he said. He later amended his complaint. Brandy has not been charged with a crime.  The district attorney’s office said it would not comment on the case before it was resolved.  Mr. Rice’s misstatements, and the affair with Ms. Delmaro, did not help his case, the private investigator, Bob Nygaard, acknowledged. But they are not unusual, he said.  “The things that make a person a perfect mark also make him a bad witness,” Mr. Nygaard said. He said prosecutors could have done more to seek out other potential victims of Ms. Delmaro.  Mr. Rice went broke. He lost his apartment in Manhattan and sold his BMW, expensive watch and laptop. He asked his father for a few thousand dollars. Now, he said, he is barely making his rent payments of $500.  Last week, Mr. Rice said he wants to return to England — “I’m trying to get it together” — but acknowledged that he had been drinking again of late, including the day of the interview.  “I don’t know if I want to make money again. I’m scared to,” he said. “I want to go home, but I want to see this through.”',0
'2020 CONTRACEPTION TARGET FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS MAY BE MISSED, REPORT WARNS The number of women and girls with access to modern contraception has increased by 24 million since a landmark family planning pledge in 2012 to improve availability, but progress remains slower than projected and risks leaving millions of women behind.  The Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) report, published on Thursday, showed that 290 million women and girls in the world’s poorest countries were using modern methods of contraception by July 2015 – an unprecedented number. It said increases in contraceptive access in the past year had helped prevent 80 million unintended pregnancies and 111,000 maternal deaths in the FP2020 partnership’s 69 focus countries.  Related: 'I didn’t know I could become pregnant after having sex for the first time' | Mary Wanjiku Mwangi  Despite this progress, the partnership said it was not on track to meet its target of providing 120 million additional women and girls with access to contraception by 2020, a pledge made at the London family planning summit in 2012.    “If we continue at this rate, we risk missing our goal – and leaving millions of women and girls without the care and services they need and deserve,” the report said. “With five years remaining until 2020, FP2020 and its partners must take immediate action to accelerate progress.”  The report showed a 32% increase in bilateral funding for family planning since 2012, with the US and UK the largest donors with a combined input of $964m last year.    Jane Hobson, senior reproductive health adviser at the UK’s Department for International Development, said funding was promising but more needed to be done. “As this year’s report shows, we are not on track to reach the 2020 goal, and we all know there is a lot more to do. We all made commitments in 2012 and we have to deliver on them,” Hobson said.    “That means prioritising family planning, keeping it on the agenda, budgeting for it, coming up with the funds for global commodities, [and] tackling the discrimination that prevents particularly young people from getting the services they need,” she said.  Related: Women caught up in conflict failed by underfunding of sexual healthcare  “It means shifting social expectations so that a girl’s worth is no longer measured in early marriage and early childbearing. It means demonstrating our support publicly so that access to rights-based voluntary contraception becomes a normal part of life for communities everywhere.”  The report highlights successes in some of the partnership’s focus countries, including Indonesia where the report was intended to be launched at the international conference on family planning this month. The Bali conference was postponed until early next year due to a volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Lombok. Indonesia introduced low-cost or free family planning to eligible couples last year and has pledged to upgrade more than 23,500 family planning clinics as part of its commitment to FP2020’s goal.  The report also noted the importance of family planning provision in times of conflict and humanitarian emergencies, claiming that more than half of all maternal, newborn and child deaths occur in these situations.  International Planned Parenthood Federation’s Owain James said it was vital to give women access to contraception during times when they were most vulnerable. “Trying to increase family planning provision in emergencies, whether it is conflict or disaster relief such as Nepal recently, is so necessary. What we see is that demand for family planning increases during this time, and too often the services just aren’t there.”  Despite the challenges, FP2020 executive director Beth Schlachter remains hopeful. “Today, three years after the 2012 London summit, our partnership is stronger than ever. The challenges ahead are immense, and we must meet them with resourcefulness, determination, and a collective sense of responsibility,” she said.',1
'IMMIGRATION SANCTUARY BAN CREATES UNCERTAINTY IN NORTH CAROLINA Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  DURHAM, N.C. — A day after Gov. Pat McCrory signed a bill prohibiting so-called sanctuary city policies in North Carolina, Jose Lopez, the police chief in Durham, was assessing the effect it would have on this city, where, for the last dozen years, police officers have been instructed to limit inquiries about a person’s immigration status.          In order for Durham to comply with the new law, Chief Lopez said, the local rule would have to come off the books. Although he said he would still recommend that his officers refrain from poking their noses into immigration matters, he predicted that rumors would spread among undocumented immigrants that it was no longer safe to cooperate with the Durham police.  “That’s going to bring a distrust,” said Chief Lopez, who is of Puerto Rican descent. He was picked eight years ago to lead the police force in this old tobacco town, home to Duke University and a Hispanic population that more than doubled last decade, but will retire at the end of the year,  Photo  “It will cause individuals to flee the police, on the belief that some minor incident is going to get them deported,” he added.  Last month, Democrats in the United States Senate blocked a Republican-backed sanctuary cities bill, despite growing pressure from conservatives to crack down on local governments that refuse to fully cooperate with federal immigration officials or, in cities like Durham, to vigorously pursue immigration investigations.  But the lack of action in Washington has only increased the ferment over the issue in some cities and states across the country.  North Carolina was the first state to turn the conservative anger into legislative action after the bill’s failure in Washington when Governor McCrory, a Republican, signed its bill into law on Oct. 28.  A week later, the sheriff of San Francisco, Ross Mirkarimi, lost his bid for re-election four months after a woman, Kathryn Steinle, was fatally shot while walking on the Embarcadero waterfront. The man accused of the shooting was an unauthorized immigrant, and Ms. Steinle’s death has played a central role in the sanctuary debate nationally.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another dispute broke out in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott accused the sheriff of Dallas County, Lupe Valdez, of failing to “fully honor” Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests. Mr. Abbott, in an Oct. 26 letter to the sheriff, argued that recent changes in her policies posed “a serious danger to Texans.”  Mr. Abbott has indicated that he would push for bills targeting such policies in Texas’ legislative session in 2017. Other bills pending in Massachusetts and Michigan would punish local governments that maintained similar policies.  “We’ve got these local governments arbitrarily choosing which laws they want to abide by,” said State Senator Mike Kowall of Michigan, a Republican who introduced the bill there.  The issue, now part of the debate over immigration politics in the Republican presidential race, took hold after the killing in San Francisco.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The suspect is a Mexican national with an extensive criminal record who had been deported five times. Before the shooting, he had been released from custody by the authorities in San Francisco, who declined to respond to a federal request that the immigration authorities be notified. Sheriff Mirkarimi said he had been barred from responding by San Francisco’s sanctuary rules, which strictly limit cooperation between the police and federal immigration officials.  Like Chief Lopez and others, Sheriff Mirkarimi has defended sanctuary policies on the ground that they help build trust between local law enforcement and the immigrants living in the city.  In North Carolina, Mr. McCrory said the legislature had acted to make sure cities enforced the law.  “It is the sworn duty of all of these officers to uphold the rule of law, and the policies that are derived from these laws, which is why no one should tie the hands of our police, and our sheriffs and other law enforcement officers,” he said upon signing the bill.  It is unclear what, if any, effect the North Carolina bill will have on officers’ immigration responses in municipalities labeled sanctuary cities by conservatives in the state, a list that includes Durham, Chapel Hill, Carrboro and Charlotte.  But the law was bound to stir passions in a state where liberals and conservatives are bitterly divided, and where clashes over immigration-related issues have been commonplace since the 1990s. During that decade, North Carolina’s immigrant population grew 274 percent — the largest percentage of any state during that time.  The day after the bill signing, about 200 activists gathered outside the Executive Mansion in Raleigh for a boisterous rally. Six protesters were arrested for blocking traffic, and others waved caricatures depicting Mr. McCrory as a Klansman.  “The governor is using his political power to bring a law that’s going to cause a lot of problems,” said Gabriela Zabala, 65, a member of El Centro Hispano, a Hispanic advocacy group. “He thinks he’s going to get a lot more votes, like Trump.”  But State Representative Chris Millis, a Republican and a sponsor of the law, which was approved in both houses on largely party-line votes, said, “In North Carolina, we want to be proactive in defense of our citizens, to prevent horrific crimes like what happened in San Francisco.”  Photo  The law prohibits cities or counties from having any policy that “limits or restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law.” It also outlaws any rule that prohibits the police from gathering immigration information on individuals.  Durham is in one of the more liberal swaths of the South, where a number of city governments have long struck a more accommodating tone. The Durham City Council passed its sanctuary resolution in October 2003, and Carrboro followed suit in May 2006.  Chapel Hill, the home of the University of North Carolina’s flagship campus, strengthened its policy later that year after an Iranian-born woman, Sima Fallahi, went to the Chapel Hill police station to apply for a business permit to sell her artwork. She was sent to a federal detention center after a background check turned up a federal immigration removal order.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  It sent a shock through the community: Ms. Fallahi was a single mother who volunteered at the local natural foods store and was involved in the parent-teacher association at her child’s school. Mayor Mark Kleinschmidt, who was on the Town Council at the time, said it was a “ham-fisted” response from the government.  Ms. Fallahi was eventually granted permanent residency in the United States. But in response to her situation, the Town Council strengthened its sanctuary policy, Mr. Kleinschmidt said. It instructed the police not to detain people when background checks turn up immigration warrants that are civil in nature, and do not indicate that the person in question is a felon or “deported criminal.”  Mr. Kleinschmidt, who lost his bid for re-election this month after a campaign in which development, not immigration, was the main issue, said he was unsure what practical effect the new law would have on Chapel Hill’s law enforcement.  Capt. Chris Atack of the Police Department in neighboring Carrboro said that while his city’s immigration policy would have to be rescinded, he did not expect officers to suddenly make immigration a priority. “From a public safety standpoint, immigration has never been of interest to us,” he said.  Supporters of the law say it will prevent local governments from adopting more comprehensive sanctuary policies like those in San Francisco. And State Representative George Cleveland, the bill’s lead author, said he hoped that it would spur the police to take more vigorous action against undocumented immigrants.  “My feeling is that they would be obligated to take these people into custody,” said Mr. Cleveland, a Republican from coastal Onslow County.  Mr. Cleveland said there was some merit to the argument that such enforcement might scare off potential witnesses to crimes. But that, he said, would be the fault of the unauthorized immigrants themselves.  “If they want to live in a community where bandits can treat them any way they want to be treated because they’re afraid to point out to law enforcement who’s doing it, that’s their problem,” he said.',0
'AMARTYA SEN: WOMEN’S PROGRESS OUTDID CHINA’S ONE-CHILD POLICY Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — THE abandonment of the one-child policy in China is a momentous change, and there is much to celebrate in the easing of restrictions on human freedom in a particularly private sphere of life. But we need to recognize that the big fall in fertility in China over the decades, for which the one-child policy is often credited, has, in fact, been less related to compulsion and much more to reasoned family decisions in favor of a new norm of smaller families.          This development has been particularly helped by the increasing empowerment of Chinese women through rapid expansion of schooling and job opportunities. What China needs now is further expansion of rethinking within families to overcome “boy preference,” which is still widespread, despite being at odds with the success of Chinese women.  This is a good moment to examine what the one-child policy has done — or not done. First, we must question the glib history that China was stuck in the adversity of high fertility rates until the policy changed it all.  The one-child policy was introduced in 1978. But the fertility rate had already been falling rapidly for a decade before that — from an average of 5.87 births per woman in 1968 to 2.98 in 1978. After that huge drop, the fertility rate continued to fall with the new draconian policy in force, but there was no plunge — only a smooth continuation of the falling trend that preceded the restriction. From 2.98 in 1978, the rate has declined to 1.67 now.  Clearly, something more than the one-child policy has been affecting birthrates in China. Statistics that compare different countries, as well as empirical analysis of data from hundreds of districts within India, indicate sharply that the two most potent factors that induce fertility reduction globally are women’s schooling and women’s paid employment.  There is no mystery in this. The lives that are most battered by over-frequent bearing and rearing of children are those of young mothers, and more schooling and more gainful employment both give young women a greater voice in family decisions — a voice that tends to work in the direction of cutting down the frequency of births. Rapid expansion in China of education, including that of girls, and the enhancement of job opportunities for young women occurred through a series of decades that began well before the introduction of the one-child policy, and they have continued robustly since.  As it happens, fertility rate declines in China have been close to what we would expect on the basis of these social influences alone. China often gets too much credit from commentators on the alleged effectiveness of its harsher interventions, and far too little for the positive role of its supportive policies (including its heavy focus on education and health care, from which many other countries can learn).  Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.  So while there are harrowing reports of the hardship created in the lives of many people in China by the enforcement of the one-child policy, it is far from clear that this policy has had a large impact on the fertility rate of the population as a whole.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The removal of the one-child policy may, in fact, have been an easy choice. There is little need for the harshness of this coercive program, given the increasing role of reasoning about family decisions, and particularly the growing empowerment of Chinese women.  This takes us back to a classic disagreement between Thomas Robert Malthus and the Marquis de Condorcet in the 18th century, at the height of the Enlightenment. Condorcet had noted the possibility of terrible overpopulation; Malthus acknowledged that he was following Condorcet in this, but he hugely exaggerated the danger when he rejected Condorcet’s reassuring argument that human reasoning would produce a corrective. Condorcet had anticipated the emergence of new norms of smaller family size based on “the progress of reason.” Buttressed by the expansion of education, especially for women (of which Condorcet was one of the earliest and most vocal advocates), he argued that people would choose voluntarily to cut the birthrate.  Reasoning in decision making is not exclusive to the West. In China it clearly has played a significant part already in restraining family size. It also has other important roles to play. Despite China’s extraordinary social and economic success (not just in economic growth), it has one of the worst records in the world in the selective abortion of female fetuses; the number of girls born per 100 male births has been as low as 85, compared with a normal rate around 95 in countries where there is little or no selective intervention against female birth. Chinese women have made huge progress in most spheres of life, but traditional “boy preference” is still rampant. However, legal remedies against sex-selective abortion, like outlawing it, have been ineffective wherever they have been tried.  What is needed is more reasoning, aided by further use of women’s empowerment, against such an arbitrary and dehumanizing bias. Such a change has, in fact, been very successfully achieved in South Korea, which once also had a very low ratio of girls to boys at birth. The cultivation of active public reasoning and wider understanding of the demands of gender equity have produced a huge change there.  China needs to rely even more on the force of reasoning, rather than on legal compulsion. The removal of the one-child policy is surely an important move in that direction. The fact that China’s demographic history over the last half-century gives firm evidence of what Condorcet called “the progress of reason” certainly gives ground for optimism. This is all the more important, since China has more challenges to address in this productive way.',1
'RUSSIAN ATHLETICS BEGINS PURGE OF DOPING SCANDAL COACHES AND OFFICIALS Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.Please install Adobe Flash ™ and try again. Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.  Russia’s athletics federation has met in Moscow to begin what the sports minister said would be a purge of its staff after the country was suspended from international competition over doping.  Russia will undertake reforms and appeal to the International Association of Athletics Federations within three months to return to competition, the sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said. At stake is the country’s participation at the world indoor championships in March and the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August.  Related: Sebastian Coe poses a very British challenge to Russia’s widespread doping | Barney Ronay  Mutko summoned the presidium of the All-Russia Athletic Federation on Sunday following the IAAF decision to indefinitely suspend Russia because of widespread violations found by a World Anti-Doping Agency commission. Mutko said on Saturday he and the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, had agreed on a “road map” for reform.  The UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, insisted that making Russian athletes miss the 2016 Rio Olympics to ensure a clean Tokyo 2020 Games would be a “price worth paying”.  “If you’ve got to have pain in Rio to ensure Tokyo is clean, so be it,” said Warner, who said he does not want a “murky compromise” to allow Russia’s return.  But Mutko told the news agency Tass that the Russian athletics federation is taking steps to ensure it will return to international competition before Rio, including replacing coaches and officials. He added he hoped its leadership would be 99% new after elections at a conference on 16 January at which a temporary federation president and presidium will be elected.  “Some may suffer in this situation, but we will remove all those whose reputation is under suspicion from the athletics management system,” Mutko said on the state television channel Rossiya 24.  “Within 60 days we will conduct a renewal of athletics, we will bring in new, modern people, we will work with the international federation to take all measures by its standards. We will take all measures recommended to us by Wada and the IAAF and in 60 days, or in three months, we will come to the international federation again so we can show that we’re meeting standards, and we hope our team will regain its rights.”  Mutko also told Rossiya 24 that Russia could turn the management of its athletics federation over to the Russian Olympic Committee, which has promised that all athletes, officials, coaches and other personnel involved in doping “will be banned from all activity related to sport and will be punished”. It is expected to lead reforms of Russia’s athletics federation, anti-doping agency and drug-testing lab.  The International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, has rowed back on his comments of Saturday that he was confident that Russia’s reform process would make the country compliant in time to compete in Rio.  Bach insisted Russian track and field athletes would only return if the country falls into line with all anti-doping rules and its reforms are verifiable. “The important goal is not bringing them back,” Bach said. “The goal has to be Russia being compliant again with all the international anti-doping regulations. If the Russian athletics federation is not compliant and the athletes cannot take part in any kind of qualifications, then the situation is clear. If you cannot qualify, you cannot participate in the Games.”  The IAAF is expected to demand Russia apologises for its behaviour, ends state interference in track and field and investigates athletes suspected of doping before it is allowed back in to competition.  Richard McLaren, a member of the Wada commission, has warned it could even recommend suspending the IAAF when it releases part two of its report, which is expected late this year. Mutko does not believe it will come to that. “If there are no athletics in Rio, it will be a complete breakdown of the Olympics,” he said. “That cannot be allowed.”',0
'1966: THE YEAR YOUTH CULTURE EXPLODED 25 March 1966, the Jefferson Airplane and the Mystery Trend played a “rock & roll dance benefit” in support of the Vietnam Day Committee. Costing $1.50 to get in, the “peace trip” was held at Harmon Gym, on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley – the institution that, after Mario Savio’s December 1964 “put your bodies on the gears” speech, had become the centre of American student radicalism, in particular the protests against the escalating Vietnam war.  The event was one of several “peace rock” benefits held in the gym that spring that cemented the link between the politicos of Berkeley and the bohemians of the nascent San Franciscan music scene: others showcased the Grateful Dead, the Great Society, and the (original) Charlatans. Citing one of these shows, the columnist Ralph Gleason observed that the city was “on the verge of another dancing craze” such as had not happened “since the swing era”. Nothing apparently untoward there.  The trouble started a few weeks later, when the San Francisco Examiner cited the Harmon Gym event in a highly critical article on Berkeley. “The sweet, acrid odour of marijuana pervaded the area, many of the dancers were obviously intoxicated,” wrote reporter Jack S McDowell. “Sexual misconduct was blatant.” The background to this was the release of an addendum to the Burns report, prepared by California’s state senate committee, which alleged communist infiltration of Berkeley’s Free Speech Movement and much more, summed up by the phrase “a deluge of filth”.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vietnam Day protest march at Berkeley. Photograph: Don Cravens/The Life Images Collection/Getty Images  Six days after the Examiner article, Ronald Reagan took the stage of the Cow Palace to deliver a defining speech of his gubernatorial campaign. He cited the Harmon Gym show as a prime example of what he called “the morality gap at Berkeley”. Conflating rock’n’roll, drugs and sex – “the nude torsos of men and women” projected by the light show – with the “filthy speech movement” and the Vietnam Day Committee, Reagan called for a root and branch examination of “the charges of communism and blatant sexual misbehaviour on the campus”. As he thundered: “What in heaven’s name does academic freedom have to do with rioting, with anarchy, with attempts to destroy the primary purpose of the university, which is to educate young people?”  Having made his name during Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign, Reagan was busy positioning himself as a figurehead in the Republican resurgence. His positions were frequently and forcefully expressed: pro-business, anti-regulation; pro-self-help (as in the the “creative society” idea – a forerunner of Cameron’s “big society”), anti-state intervention; pro-the squeezed middle-aged, anti- the long-hairs, communists and war protesters who seemingly thronged the campus of Berkeley.  Reagan’s claims about the Harmon Gym concert were, his biographer Robert Dallek concedes, “vastly exaggerated”. However they were in service to a powerful feeling: namely that, faced with the symptoms of incipient psychedelia, many adults were convinced the freedoms of popular culture and President Lyndon B Johnson’s “great society” had got out of hand. It wasn’t just sex and drugs, but anti-war protest and inner-city riot. Things were going too far too fast. It was time to apply the brakes, and Reagan would be the most visible agent of that backlash.  The 1960s remain in the folk memory as a golden age of pop culture, with 1966 enshrined in the UK as the year of swinging London and the winning of the World Cup. It was the year of the singles that are regularly collected on those TV advertised compilations you buy for £5 and under: Sunny Afternoon; Reach Out I’ll Be There; Good Vibrations; Summer in the City – mass pop art so imperishable that it cannot be dimmed by cheap nostalgia and endless repetition.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vietnam Day Committee supporters Jefferson Airplane. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images  But 1966 was a year of turmoil. It began in pop and ended in rock; began in civil rights and ended in black power; began in the great society and ended in the Republican resurgence. Inspired by the success of the civil rights movement and boosted by the money pouring into the music and youth industries, young people in the US and the UK began to think of another way of life, that didn’t involve being like your parents. They were beginning to envision what the future might be.  It was also the year that the torch passed from England to America, from London to Los Angeles, which became the central pop location, thanks to the Mamas and the Papas, the Beach Boys, and the Monkees – ersatz Beatles who bloomed just as the originals left the stage. California had its own youthtopias, reasonably autonomous zones where the young could congregate and try out new ways of living: the Haight/Ashbury in San Francisco, the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.

Pop’s Herculean acceleration resulted in many casualties: during 1966, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones all crashed out from the pace, but not before they had provocatively expressed their dissatisfaction – Dylan with his polarising electric show segments, the Beatles with their notorious “Butcher” LP sleeve (pulped by their American record company, Capitol, at a cost of $200,000), the Rolling Stones with the drag video for Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?  At the same time, there were the new total environments: the lightshows of the San Franciscan ballrooms, the op art designs of cavernous new discotheques like New York’s Cheetah, the sensorium of Andy Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable, which gave the impression of “everything occurring simultaneously”. By 1966, many strands of art, music, and entertainment were all coming to the same point by different means: the total focus on the instant that is the hallmark of many eastern religions; the happening; the drug experience; the ecstasy of dancing.  It was also a year of incredible fertility in black American music. To name just one artist: James Brown visited the UK for the first time in March; played Madison Square Garden in April; appeared on Ed Sullivan for the first time in May, with his own musicians. In late June, he was the only major pop star to play for the activists on the March Against Fear, two days after they had been tear-gassed by state troopers: this was the last great united action of the civil rights movement and the moment when Stokely Carmichael launched the idea of Black Power.  James Brown also made one of two records that, during 1966, completely exploded linear time in their respective quests for the perpetual present. The first was Tomorrow Never Knows. The second was on the flip of the single Don’t Be A Drop-Out: Brown placed a song called Tell Me That You Love Me, adapted from a live recording. Looping the vocal with a guitar figure by Lonnie Mack, Brown and producer Bud Hopgood created a shocking delirium of sound with an insanely fast drum pattern that directly prefigured drum’n’bass, nearly 30 years later.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A shocking delirium of sound ... James Brown. Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns  Pop music was the new Olympus. Lou Reed recognised it as the arena for his generation: “The music is the only live, living thing.” Writing in the same issue of Aspen magazine, Robert Shelton agreed: “The age of the new mass arts is moving us upward, inward, outward and forward. In this era of exploration, there are many breeds of navigators, but few more daring than the poet-musicians who are leading our pop music in new directions … expressing an avant-garde, underground philosophy to a mass audience, deepening the thinking of masses of young people.”  Many records by those “poet-musicians” made the charts. The most obvious example is the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations, recorded in sessions that spanned 60 hours over seven months, at a cost of $50,000. It was technological yet emotional, sensual and spiritual – designed as a moment of fusion that would reset pop culture’s polarity to positive.  What was thrilling about 1966 was the way in which things were not business as usual, a feeling that can still be heard in the records of the year: music was connected to events outside the pop culture bubble and was understood to do so by many of its listeners. It was a year when audacious ideas and experiments were at a premium in the mass market and in youth culture, with a corresponding reaction from those for whom the rate of change was too quick.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The ecstasy of dancing ... Photograph: Lövenich/ullstein bild via Getty Images  The more the young pushed forward, the more the adults pushed back. In the summer, the most famous pop group in the world came up against immutable forces: xenophobic rightwing protesters in Tokyo; the agents of President Marcos, taking physical revenge for an alleged insult; and the deep south disc jockeys who, incensed by the reprinting of John Lennon’s comments about the Beatles being “more popular than Jesus”, organised boycotts, threatened the group’s tour and conducted “Beatle Burnings”.  The polarity had flipped from positive to negative. The Beatles seemed to have become a lightning rod for all sorts of tensions that had little to do with their music: they had become a target for all those who resisted the pace of change. In August the writer James Morris declared that “the Beatles’ absolute aloofness to old prejudices and preconceptions, their brand of festive iconoclasm, has developed an attraction for me, as it has for millions more sceptics the world over”. But this iconoclasm had its dangers. As Morris quoted an elderly acquaintance: “I’ll tell you what the trouble with the Beatles is: they’ve got no respect.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Technological, but sensual and spiritual ... the Beach Boys. Photograph courtesy of Jon Savage  More than any other year thus far in that decade, it was the time when that increasingly assertive and visible youth culture collided with realpolitik. In the UK, Time magazine’s idea of Swinging London came up against the Labour government’s wage freeze: another kind of austerity. “The age of pop” seemed to be swinging “to a stop”, observed the Sunday Times that August. Late in the year, a senior Time magazine editor opined that “swingin’ has got out of hand because it is the kind of fun only a rich nation can afford – and England is no longer a rich nation.”  While Good Vibrations was rising to No 1 in the UK and the US, the anti-youth culture backlash began. Within a week of Reagan’s election as governor of California, a major disturbance erupted on the the Sunset Strip, when a protest by over a thousand teens – incensed by the heavy-handed policing of archaic curfew laws – provoked a strong reaction. With LA being a media centre, it made national news. Over the next few weeks, both sides escalated their rhetoric, climaxing in brutal police beatings on 26 November and 10 December.  What was left after the Sunset Strip riots was an unpleasant aftertaste, a harbinger of the more serious flashpoints to come. For what it seemed to come down to was generational warfare – what Derek Taylor, then the Beach Boys’ PR, called “the whole rotten issue of the Old v the Young”. As the journalist Jerry Hopkins wrote that December, just after the height of the rioting, “the fact remains that there are two factions, two sides. One generation does not understand or refuses to try to understand the one behind it … the line has been drawn.”  The young had begun to flex their muscles – to see beyond a market to a different way of life. As Time reported, “In the US, citizens of 25 and under in 1966 nearly outnumbered their elders: by 1970, there will be 100 million Americans in that age bracket … If the statistics imply change, the credentials of the younger generation guarantee it. Never have the young been so assertive or so articulate, so well educated or so worldly. Predictably, they are a highly independent breed and – to adult eyes – their independence has made them highly unpredictable.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Police search African American youths during the Watts riots. Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock  The 60s peaked in 1966; it was the year when the decade exploded. The songs from that time still enchant successive generations, but they were also a response to their place and time. It was, as the writer and cultural catalyst Tony Hall said that December, “pretty obvious that contemporary music reflects contemporary life and vice versa.” Pop did reflect the world during 1966, that there was something more than image and sales at stake.  It wasn’t just the sudden loosening of bonds caused by the Beatles’ success and the money that flowed into the youth sector. The music of that year co-existed with the move towards greater social freedom, whether in the liberalising legislation of the UK’s Labour government or the various US liberation movements, civil rights groups like the SNCC and the SCLC, the National Organisation of Women, homophile groups like the Daughters of Bilitis, Vanguard or the Mattachine Society. It spoke of the drive towards democracy and openness that makes it still contested today, that militate against the generational nostalgia that renders the period rote.  What’s fascinating is how politicised the High 60s remain. This era has consistently been denigrated by rightwing politicians over a 30 year period, since the Reagan/Thatcher era. The structures of society have been altered – in particular by laws relating to youth benefits, structural unemployment etc – to remove power from youth as a cohort. But still the High 60s are dismissed by various pundits and historians, as overhyped, unrealistic, elitist, “only a few people in London” – quite apart from the ad hominem attacks on major figures. That viewpoint – proposed by the likes of Dominic Sandbrook – in itself is interesting: why do they do it and who does it benefit?  Today’s neo-liberals see everything in strictly financial terms and seek to impose that vision on the rest of us. It’s all about money, nothing else. But, as the old saying goes, they know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. Attempting to reprogram the mid-60s in that guise, while a tempting provocation, simply succeeds in smearing the past with the values of the present. Going back to the primary sources, you enter an entirely different world. During 1966, young people were creating an exciting, progressive mass culture in plain sight. They dared to dream. For a while, they got away with it, and that spirit remains inspirational.  • 1966: The Year The Decade Exploded by Jon Savage (Faber & Faber, £20) is published on 19 November.

'NOVAK DJOKOVIC DISMANTLES KEI NISHIKORI AT ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS Kei Nishikori was the latest to succumb to the runaway train that is Novak Djokovic as the world No1 coasted to victory in his opening match at the ATP World Tour Finals in London.  Related: Jamie Murray and John Peers win dramatic ATP World Tour Finals opener  The statistics of Djokovic’s season get more impressive by the day and he needed only 65 minutes to defeat Nishikori 6-1, 6-1 and register a 23rd consecutive win. The O2 Arena turned red, white and blue prior to the match as a minute’s silence was observed for the victims of Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris.  Once attention turned back to matters on court Djokovic, who has lost just one set since his US Open final victory over Roger Federer, wasted no time in stamping his authority on the match, establishing a 3-0 lead. Nishikori battled hard to get on the board in the fourth game but that was as good as it got as the Serb, his game and his movement razor sharp, reeled off the next three.  Djokovic is even more dominant indoors than he is outside. He is unbeaten since 2012 and is bidding to become the first player to win four successive World Tour Finals titles. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nishikori looked at a loss as to how to trouble the Serb and he made the worst possible start to the second set, dropping serve for a third time.  Djokovic was playing with swagger and a nonchalant backhand volley gave him the most comfortable of opening wins.  Earlier, Jamie Murray and Australian John Peers marked their debut at the tournament with victory over the Australian Open champions Fabio Fognini and Simone Bolelli in a match that, unlike the singles, was a real contest.',0
'A GRIM BREAST CANCER MILESTONE FOR BLACK WOMEN Photo  African-American women in the United States have reached a dubious milestone. For the first time, the incidence of breast cancer among black women is equal to that of white women, according to a sweeping new report from the American Cancer Society.  The finding is worrisome because breast cancer has historically been more deadly in black women than in white women, but at least it has not been as common. Now, as incidence rates equalize, data suggests that breast cancer will continue to exact a far greater toll on black women, and that the trend shows no sign of abating.  “It is a crisis,” said Marc Hurlbert, chief mission officer for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. “The increasing incidence is unfortunate because the mortality rate for black women is already so much higher, and now if more women are getting breast cancer, then unfortunately, the number of black women dying from the disease will go up.”  Over all, the report painted a grim picture of the state of breast cancer in African-American women, showing that advances in diagnosis and treatment that have sharply improved survival rates from breast cancer and saved countless lives have largely bypassed African-American women. By virtually every measure of the disease — age of diagnosis, age of death, stage of diagnosis — black women are at a significant disadvantage compared with white women, the data show.  Photo  The reasons for the increase are complex and are thought to be driven largely by rising obesity rates among African-American women. Researchers also believe that changes in reproductive patterns may play a role, as more African-American women delay childbirth and have fewer children. Both are recognized risk factors for breast cancer.  Black women are given breast cancer diagnoses at younger ages and die from the disease at younger ages than white women, suggesting that the disease may exact a greater economic and family toll on blacks by stealing more of a woman’s most productive years. The median age at diagnosis is 58 for black women and 62 for white women. The median age for breast cancer death is 62 for black women and 68 for white women.  The data for the report was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, a program that has been collecting information on cancer patients since 1973.  Among white women, breast cancer incidence rates have been stable since 2004, hovering around 135 per 100,000 women. But among black women, rates have been consistently lower, ranging from 119 to 125 per 100,000. But in 2012, a startling change occurred. The incidence rate moved to 135 cases per 100,000 women for both white and black women.  “The lines have crossed for the first time,” said Carol E. DeSantis, senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society and the lead author of the report. “There is variation in year-to-year rates, especially in smaller populations such as in black women, but I think, over all, the picture we’ve seen is this slow steady increase in black women and stable rates in white women.”  While it is possible that a fraction of the rise could be attributed to earlier detection, that would not fully explain the trend because rates at which women are being screened for breast cancer have remained stable. As a result, the trends suggest that the uptick in incidence is not a result of doctors simply finding more cases of breast cancer, but is probably the result of other factors.  “To me the bottom line of these statistics is the evidence that the health disparity between African-American and white women in the U.S. is still going strong,” said Kirsten Moysich, a professor of oncology at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo. “And it’s even more pronounced than previously reported.”  Obesity is considered a risk factor because it has been linked to an increased risk of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, and much of the increase in breast cancers among black women has been due largely to more cases of this type of tumor. The obesity rate in black women was 58 percent during the 2009 to 2012 period, up from 39 percent from 1999 to 2002. Meanwhile, the obesity rate among white women has stabilized at around 33 percent.  Over all, a black woman given a breast cancer diagnosis is 42 percent more likely to die from the disease than a white woman with breast cancer. An analysis of breast cancer mortality trends in 41 of the largest cities in the United States, published last year in Cancer Epidemiology, found that in some cities the risk is even greater. In Los Angeles, a black woman with breast cancer is about 70 percent more likely to die from the disease than a white woman is. In Memphis, black women face more than double the risk. Black women also are less likely than white women are to be given a diagnosis of early stage disease, and more likely to be given a diagnosis with later stage, and less treatable, tumors, according to the report.  Compared with white women, black women were more likely to be found to have an aggressive form of the disease called triple negative breast cancer, which has a poorer prognosis, in part, because there are not targeted therapies to treat it. Triple negative breast cancers account for 22 percent of the cases among black women, and 11 percent among white women.  Black women also lag white women in diagnosis of estrogen-receptor positive disease, the most treatable form of breast cancer. Among white women, 76 percent of cancers diagnosed are ER positive, compared with 62 percent in black women.  Researchers say the racial divide in breast cancer mortality may be because of a combination of factors, including disparities in the quality of care available to black women, who may have less access to quality screening and treatment, compared with white women. Lower rates of follow-up after a mammogram, cultural distrust of doctors, and lack of insurance coverage among black women may also play a role.  Dr. Hurlbert said the report should prompt not only more research, but more efforts to include black women in clinical trials. “Percentage enrollment in trials has been low for black women,” Dr. Hurlbert said. “So do the drugs work as well on them? We don’t know.”  Dr. Hurlbert said there were so many unanswered questions, that it will take some time before the data begin to influence clinical practice, but he hopes doctors will take it to heart and be more vigilant when they are treating black women and offer more follow up and support when needed. He also encouraged women to talk to their doctors about genetic cancer screening and have regular mammograms.  “Because breast cancer has shown up in younger ages for black women, they should be very vigilant,” Dr. Hurlbert said. “But the really big issue is that we hope it does raise alarm bells that more needs to be done in these populations.”  Video  Related:',1
'SQUARE'S IPO: THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE UNICORN-DRIVEN TECH BUBBLE? There are a lot of people in Silicon Valley and New York betting on “unicorns” – the new breed of tech startups like Uber, Square, Airbnb and Snapchat that have been valued at least $1bn.  Not since the last dotcom boom has so much money been poured into so many hyped companies. As startup founders and their investors hope to turn their paper unicorn fortunes into cold hard cash, some of Silicon Valley’s most successful investors are warning a reckoning is coming. And on Monday that magical thinking faces one of its biggest tests.  Square, the mobile payments platform co-founded by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, will sell shares in New York at a $4bn valuation. A year ago, private investors valued Square at $6bn. Now questions are being asked about whether Dorsey can really juggle his duties at troubled Twitter and a once hot startup that has yet to show any signs of making a profit. If Monday’s initial public offering (IPO) goes badly, a lot of other profitless unicorns will start feeling the chill.    One big problem for the unicorns is that there are simply too many of them. When the term was coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013, unicorn was the perfect way to encapsulate something rare, magical and mythical: in this case, a $1bn startup.  Related: We should be suspicious of Silicon Valley unicorns and their exorbitant valuations | Mike Daisey  But analysts and investors say the version 2.0 tech bubble has inflated so much that the term unicorn no longer fits. So much private money (increasingly from established institutional investors, which previously steered clear of such risky investments) has been pumping into tech firms that $1bn startups are no longer rare, magical or mythical, and it could mean that the tech bubble is about to burst again. “I do think you’ll see some dead unicorns this year,” Bill Gurley, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Benchmark, has said.  Another VC, Todd Dagres of Spark Capital in Boston, said: “If you wake up in a room full of unicorns, you are dreaming and you can’t expect the dream to continue.”  In November 2013, only 39 tech startups had been worth $1bn pre-flotation in the past decade (Google and Amazon were worth nowhere near $1bn before their IPOs). Today there are 82 $1bn pre-IPO startups in the US and a total of 125 worldwide, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. The combined valuation of all US unicorns is $486bn – more than the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Austria, Colombia or South Africa – and not one has made any profit, as they are all concentrated on aggressively spending to expand their reach and thereby increase their valuation before floatation.  There are so many unicorns that Silicon Valley needs a new term to describe the most successful new firms: the decacorn, a made-up word for a startup worth more than $10bn. There are still quite a few of these. Uber this summer was valued at $51bn (£33.4bn) (that’s almost four times as much as Marks & Spencer is worth); Airbnb attracted $2.5bn more investment in June that valued it at $25.5bn (£16.8bn); and Snapchat’s latest funding round valued the disappearing-photo app at $16bn (£10.5bn).  There is a growing unease among investors that few, if any, of these companies are really worth the valuations they have attracted, which would make the tech bubble burst as it did at the turn of the century.  Attention this week turned to Snapchat when established mutual fund Fidelity wrote down the value of its investment in the four-year-old company, which is used by more than 100m people a day, by 25%. Fidelity has also written down its stake in Dropbox, the cloud storage company, by 31%, and the company has quietly dropped its IPO plans. In 2014 it was valued at $10bn, but its bankers have warned it will struggle to attract anywhere near that on the public market.  Eyes are now turning towards Square – a payment system that allows anyone to take credit payments via a card reader attached to an iPad – which has announced its plans to float in New York. But it won’t be a celebratory moment for all investors.  Square, which gave potential investors a square-shaped 250-page prospectus over lunch in Manhattan’s chic Midtown Loft & Terrace this week, is also facing questions over the abilities of Dorsey. His other company, Twitter is failing to match Wall Street’s expectations on revenue or profits, and user growth has all but dried up with new users increasing by just 1.3% in its latest quarter. The company’s shares, which peaked at $69 in January 2014, were changing hands for $26 on Friday – the exact value they were floated at in November 2013. Dorsey, 38, is currently juggling the CEO role of both companies.  Many feel Square’s IPO could, in hindsight, be seen as the trigger that burst the 2.0 tech bubble, that it could wipe billions off the values of the biggest beasts such as Uber that are hoping to follow it down the IPO path.  Ominously, as the company announced the price range its former chief operating officer Keith Rabois tweeted: “The steroid era of start-ups is over.”  “I think Square is the beginning of the end of the tech bubble,” Sam Hamadeh, founder and chief executive of financial research firm PrivCo, said. “In terms of the number of unicorns, I have never seen anything like it in 25 years.    “With Square, not only is it the first one where investors are being asked to take a haircut going into it, but I think it will get worse. What already sounds horrible will go on to be terrible.”  Hamadeh said he expects some of Square’s early investors will lose out on their original investments, while late-stage investors have been guaranteed at least a 20% return on the $15.46 they paid last year on the IPO. The company has promised to issue new shares to pay for that return if the shares don’t achieve it in the flotation.  Investors will look back and say ‘That was insane’, and the date everyone starts to realise that will be Square’s IPO Sam Hamadeh, PrivCo founder and chief executive  He said investors are prepared to accept a loss, as they have “come to the realisation that ‘yes, we overpaid’”.  “It’s not just Square – a lot of these unicorn funding rounds have been massively overpaid. It is because there has been a disproportionately large amount of investment from established firms that did not invest in startups five years ago, but have gotten into it because they feel they have been missing out,” he said. “But they will be the biggest losers. In our opinion, they have no business being in this space; they will look back and say ‘That was insane’, and the date everyone starts to realise that will be the date of Square’s IPO.”  Alan Patrick, co-founder of technology consultancy Broadsight, agreed that there has been too much “irrational enthusiasm” for investing in startups, and it is unlikely to be matched by what the market is prepared to pay at IPOs. “The private market has been driving these valuations to extraordinary levels, and as they approach the public market the smart money is starting look at it and go ‘oh no, no, no’.  “The number of unicorns is a sign that there is a bubble in the private market – in the dotcom era there were 10 or something, now there are too many to count,” he said. “That for me is a sign that these values are untested and out of step with reality. And none of them are making money, they are all buying revenue with huge war chests.”  Patrick reckoned the 2.0 tech bubble will come to be defined by the unicorn. “Whether it’s the ‘big swinging dick’ of the last one [the build-up to the financial crisis], there is alway a name that attached to a bubble; for this one it will be the unicorn.”  But he added that he doesn’t think the bubble is about to burst just yet. For that to happen, he said, there needs to be an “insanity event” – “something that in hindsight is so extraordinarily crazy, but looked normal at time”.  “Last time it was AOL-Time Warner [a $165bn takeover]. It’ll be an event when everyone goes, ‘Oh my god, that was nuts’,” he said. “That’s what I’m waiting for, and when that happens you blow the whistle.”',0
'THE END OF THE LINE FOR INDIA’S ICONIC RAILWAY BUFFET CAR The world outside the window changes quickly and often: farmers labouring in the fields, office workers making the daily commute, kids playing cricket wherever there’s enough space for a game. I’m on the Suvidha Special, a sleeper train from the southern city of Bangalore to Kolkata, 1,200 miles to the north-east.  A man in a uniform hovers above my seat, asking a question so often heard in India: “Veg or non-veg?” The pantry car, from where my meal will be prepared before being brought to and served at my seat, is an Indian institution.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alamy  India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, sees high-speed trains as crucial to the country’s development. He does not feel the same way about the iconic pantry car. Indian Railways will soon phase them out and replace them with “e-catering” and takeaways, “because people want different types of food,” says a railway spokesman. “This way we can offer pizza, burgers or continental [European] food.”  On the Suvidha, meals are included in the price of the ticket (about £6 for the meal package, whichever class you’re in), and the attendant comes around, giving out bedding. Then comes the food – served to your berth, eaten off your lap.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alamy  For breakfast, staff dish out omelettes, bread and butter on the side. Lunch comes packed in aluminium foil containers: there’s dal, rice and roti, a flavoursome yellow gravy masking a couple of overcooked eggs, a pot of curd to aid digestion, and vanilla ice-cream for dessert. In between, waiters pour countless rounds of slightly spicy, very sweet chai, served in an espresso-sized paper cups.  The Suvidha trundles up the east coast of India, alongside the Bay of Bengal, continues on towards the lower Ganges Delta. The journey takes 30 hours – but I’m sure it will feel much longer without the pantry car staff doing the rounds, without the question they pose to passengers three times a day: “Veg or non-veg?”',0
'IBM’S DESIGN-CENTERED STRATEGY TO SET FREE THE SQUARES Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Phil Gilbert is a tall man with a shaved head and wire-rimmed glasses. He typically wears cowboy boots and bluejeans to work — hardly unusual these days, except he’s an executive at IBM, a company that still has a button-down suit-and-tie reputation. And in case you don’t get the message from his wardrobe, there’s a huge black-and-white photograph hanging in his office of a young Bob Dylan, hunched over sheet music, making changes to songs in the “Highway 61 Revisited” album. It’s an image, Mr. Gilbert will tell you, that conveys both a rebel spirit and hard work.          Let’s not get carried away. Mr. Gilbert, who is 59 years old, is not trying to redefine an entire generation. On the other hand, he wants to change the habits of a huge company as it tries to adjust to a new era, and that is no small task.  IBM, like many established companies, is confronting the relentless advance of digital technology. For these companies, the question is: Can you grow in the new businesses faster than your older, lucrative businesses decline?  Photo  Mr. Gilbert answers that question with something called design thinking. (His title is general manager of design.) Among other things, design thinking flips traditional technology product development on its head. The old way is that you come up with a new product idea and then try to sell it to customers. In the design thinking way, the idea is to identify users’ needs as a starting point.  Mr. Gilbert and his team talk a lot about “iteration cycles,” “lateral thinking,” “user journeys” and “empathy maps.” To the uninitiated, the canons of design thinking can sound mushy and self-evident. But across corporate America, there is a rising enthusiasm for design thinking not only to develop products but also to guide strategy and shape decisions of all kinds. The September cover article of the Harvard Business Review was “The Evolution of Design Thinking.” Venture capital firms are hiring design experts, and so are companies in many industries.  Still, the IBM initiative stands out. The company is well on its way to hiring more than 1,000 professional designers, and much of its management work force is being trained in design thinking. “I’ve never seen any company implement it on the scale of IBM,” said William Burnett, executive director of the design program at Stanford University. “To try to change a culture in a company that size is a daunting task.”  Daunting seems an understatement. IBM has more than 370,000 employees. While its revenues are huge, the company’s quarterly reports have shown them steadily declining in the last two years. The falloff in revenue is partly intentional, as the company sold off less profitable operations, but the sometimes disappointing profits are not, and they reflect IBM’s struggle with its transition. Last month, the company shaved its profit target for 2015.  In recent years, the company has invested heavily in new fields, including data analytics, cloud computing, mobile technology, security, social media software for business and its Watson artificial intelligence technology. Those businesses are growing rapidly, generating revenue of $25 billion last year, and IBM forecasts that they will contribute $40 billion by 2018, through internal growth and acquisitions. Just recently, for example, IBM agreed to pay $2 billion for the Weather Company (not including its television channel), gaining its real-time and historical weather data to feed into Watson and analytics software.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But IBM’s biggest businesses are still the traditional ones — conventional hardware, software and services — which contribute 60 percent of its revenue and most of its profit. And these IBM mainstays are vulnerable, as customers increasingly prefer to buy software as a service, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers.  Virginia M. Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, has warned that this will be a difficult transition year. It will take time, she says, before its new businesses are large enough to become engines of growth for the whole company. The strategy, she insists, is the right one. What remains is to move ahead faster. “People ask, ‘Is there a silver bullet?’” Ms. Rometty said in a recent interview. “The silver bullet, you might say, is speed, this idea of speed.”  Ms. Rometty is pulling other levers to accelerate the pace of change at IBM, but she said, “Design thinking is at the center.”  Breaking With the Past  Recognizing the importance of design is not new, certainly not at IBM. In the 1950s, Thomas J. Watson Jr., then the company’s chief executive, brought on Eliot Noyes, a distinguished architect and industrial designer, to guide a design program at IBM. And Noyes, in turn, tapped others including Paul Rand, Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen in helping design everything from corporate buildings to the eight-bar corporate logo to the IBM Selectric typewriter with its golf-ball-shaped head.  At that time, and for many years, design meant creating eye-pleasing, functional products. Now design thinking has broader aims, as a faster, more productive way of organizing work: Look at problems first through the prism of users’ needs, research those needs with real people and then build prototype products quickly.  Defining problems more expansively is part of the design-thinking ethos. At a course in New York recently, a group of IBM managers were given pads and felt-tip pens and told to sketch designs for “the thing that holds flowers on a table” in two minutes. The results, predictably, were vases of different sizes and shapes.  Next, they were given two minutes to design “a better way for people to enjoy flowers in their home.” In Round 2, the ideas included wall placements, a rotating flower pot run by solar power and a software app for displaying images of flowers on a home TV screen.  Mr. Gilbert came to design thinking as a technologist and a software entrepreneur. He helped build Lombardi Software, in Austin, Tex., first as its chief technology officer and then president. Over the years, in trying to develop software faster and to improve products, he studied and adopted some of the design principles of people like David Kelley, chairman of the global design company IDEO and a founder of the Stanford design program.  Photo  In 2010, when IBM bought Lombardi Software, with its 220 people, he had no inkling of what lay ahead for him.  When Ms. Rometty became chief executive in January 2012, she told her executive team that she wanted to improve — “to rethink and reimagine” — the experience of IBM’s customers. This was motivated partly by a shift in how businesses were buying technology. As more purchased software as a service over the Internet, buying decisions were often being made by workers in functional departments — human relations, sales, marketing and data analytics — rather than by a central corporate information technology office. In this new market, software that was tailored to workers’ needs and could be used without technical help from IT employees would win the day.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At a top-management meeting, Robert J. LeBlanc, a senior software executive, mentioned that there was a guy in Austin, at a start-up IBM had acquired, who was a design and user-experience fanatic. Mr. LeBlanc called Mr. Gilbert and asked if he thought the design work he was doing in a small corner of the software business could be done across IBM. Mr. Gilbert replied that he didn’t know but it was worth considering. After a couple of days’ study, Mr. Gilbert came back and said that to have an impact, IBM had to be prepared to hire and train 1,000 designers.  Mr. Gilbert assumed that would be the end of the matter. But two weeks later, he got a call from Ms. Rometty. “Go,” she said, as he recalled. “And how fast can you go? How many can you hire in the first year?”  The Need for Speed  Since the program began in August 2012, IBM has hired several hundred designers, about two-thirds of them freshly minted college graduates and a third experienced designers. By the end of this year, IBM plans to have 1,100 designers working throughout the company, on the way to a target total of 1,500. They are embedded in IBM product teams and work alongside customers in the field or at one of 24 design studios around the world.  IBM has hired designers from top schools like Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the Rhode Island School of Design and Parsons School of Design. But initially, recruiting required skillful persuasion. When Mr. Gilbert first showed up at the graduate design school at Stanford, he was greeted with skepticism. “These are millennials in Silicon Valley — they think Google is an old company,” Mr. Burnett said, recalling their first impression. “To them, IBM was a historical relic.”  Photo  The recruiting pitch made by Mr. Gilbert and his colleagues has been essentially twofold: First, you can make a difference in socially important fields because IBM’s technology plays a crucial role in health care, energy, transportation, water and even agriculture. Second, you can be part of a groundbreaking effort to apply design thinking in business.  At Stanford, the prevailing view of working for IBM, Mr. Burnett said, has shifted from “Are you kidding me?” to “This is a pretty interesting opportunity.”  Joe Kendall thinks so. Mr. Kendall, 28, finished a two-year graduate design program at Stanford and joined IBM in June. He chose IBM over Apple, where he would have worked in its iPhone business. At Apple, he figured, his opportunity would be to help make a great product a little bit better. At IBM, Mr. Kendall sees a different opportunity. “No one is using design thinking to solve problems on this scale,” he said, adding that he could be part of “changing the future of this giant entity.”  IBM’s senior managers have all been through design training. Ms. Rometty and her executive team were among the first. The training varies, with executives getting one-day sessions; product managers, a week; and new designers, three-month programs. In all, about 8,000 IBM employees so far have had some in-person training in design thinking. It’s an impressive number, but it’s also only 2 percent of the work force.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  How broadly design thinking is being embraced across IBM is hard to say. It is a new, unfamiliar ingredient in the corporate mix. Doug Powell, a leading design expert who joined Mr. Gilbert’s team in 2013, said, “It’s not as though the masses of IBM were waiting for us to arrive.”  The incubator for the company’s ambitious experiment in corporate culture renovation can be found in a building on a corporate campus in Austin. Above a sprawling open-plan space, metal tracks fit movable whiteboard walls, creating temporary rooms — “huddle spaces” — for small teams of workers, rarely more than a dozen. The walls are covered with drawings, text and Post-it notes — “idea parking lots,” they’re called. If teams have to travel and don’t meet for a week or two, the walls come down and are stored in steel transport carts, notes and sketches intact.  The space constantly changes, as teams form or disband, add people or shed them, according to the nature of the work.  Photo  “In a week, every one of these configurations will be different,” Mr. Gilbert observed, as he toured the floor.  The work groups assemble from across IBM — hardware, software and services, but also from departments like marketing and communications. Customers are often in the mix, especially when collaborating with IBM developers to write cloud software applications. Getting clients into the free-form work space, Mr. Gilbert said, can help “fundamentally change their relationship with IBM.”  That proved to be the case for GameStop, a video game and electronics retailer. Jeff Donaldson, a GameStop technology executive, recalled that IBM’s reputation at the company’s suburban Dallas headquarters was as a slow-moving corporate bureaucracy, dominated by a sales culture offering expensive hardware and software. The reputation, he said, was “certainly not positive.”  But in the last year or so, the two companies have worked side by side — often in IBM’s Austin studio — to figure out better ways to serve GameStop customers with mobile devices and data. The floor staff at GameStop’s more than 4,100 stores in the United States can now tap iPads to look up the past purchases of customers who have downloaded the GameStop app or joined the company’s loyalty program. Coupons, trade-ins and loyalty-point rewards can be offered on the spot, as well as game recommendations.  The cloud software to make it happen was built in a few months, tested in a small group of stores and then quickly rolled out nationwide. Further projects are in the works to study how online behavior affects buying patterns.  “They’ve completely turned us around,” Mr. Donaldson said. “We’re working with the fast company part of IBM.”  Strength From Adversity  If you ask people inside IBM for a design-thinking success story, they are likely to mention Bluemix, a software tool kit for making cloud applications. In just one year, Bluemix went from an idea to a software platform that has attracted many developers, who are making apps used in industries as varied as consumer banking and wine retailing. In the past, building that kind of technology ecosystem would have taken years.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Software developers are just as important as customers to IBM, since both groups create markets. “We wanted to redefine IBM for developers,” said Damion Heredia, an IBM vice president who leads the Bluemix operation.  Like most of IBM’s new units, Bluemix is run much like a start-up, at arm’s length from the corporate bureaucracy. Mr. Heredia, who worked closely with Mr. Gilbert for years, is steeped in design-thinking methods. His team studied how young programmers built cloud apps. Tarun Gangwani, a manager in the Bluemix unit, recalled traveling to all-night “hackathons” to watch developers as they worked, step by step. Guided by what they learned, the Bluemix team built prototype software, tested it with users, and modified and refined it.  When a free test version of Bluemix was offered in February 2014, Mr. Heredia figured it might attract 2,000 developers in the first few months. It reached that number within a week, and a commercial version was introduced that July. Today, Bluemix is signing up 10,000 new users a week.  As software becomes more an online service, analysts say, the big corporate contracts that have sustained IBM’s software business will become less frequent. “For IBM, the dollars are going to have to come from sharply expanding its customer base so that developers at all kinds of companies, including start-ups, see IBM as a place to go to build new things,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst of the market research firm IDC. “That’s not been IBM’s reputation, and that’s the challenge Bluemix faces.”  IBM has an impressive track record of corporate evolution over its 104-year history. At different times, the minicomputer, the personal computer and the Internet were seen as threats to its survival. IBM’s deepest crisis — and revival — came in the 1990s after the collapsing economics of the mainframe business sent it into a tailspin. IBM was often late to new markets, but each time it adapted.  The company’s predicament today has echoes of the past. IBM is gaining ground now, but it was late to the cloud business, behind Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce. The company’s financial performance is deteriorating, but it is still a corporation that generated nearly $16 billion in net profit from continuing operations last year. Its old-line businesses are in retreat, but with Watson it seems to be at the forefront of applying data-driven artificial intelligence to mainstream industries.  John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees several of the new businesses and research, is a 36-year IBM veteran who has experienced plenty of ups and downs and shifts in strategy.  This time, Mr. Kelly observed, is different in one way. “In the past, we changed what we were working on, but we were pretty much working the same way,” he said. “Now, we’re changing how we work too. And the how element is always related to speed.”  The pace and trajectory of the business are the big questions about IBM today. IBM’s stock price has declined 16 percent in the last year. Ms. Rometty is under pressure — and that pressure will not ease until its new businesses overshadow its legacy products. “The theory is that the new lines of business grow faster than the old ones decline, but we’ve not seen it yet,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.  Asked what she tells anxious large shareholders, Ms. Rometty replied that “the key message” is that IBM is the only technology company that is more than a century old because it has reinvented itself repeatedly in the past, and it is doing so again today. “And that does take some time — yes, it does,” Ms. Rometty said. “But don’t underestimate us. This is in our DNA, this ability to transform.”',0
'WHITE HOUSE TO ANNOUNCE $118 MILLION PUBLIC, PRIVATE EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS OF COLOR   (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  The White House Council on Women and Girls will host an all-day forum Friday to explore ways to improve the lives of women and girls of color, including a commitment of $118 million in assistance from public and private organizations.  The initiative comes after President Obama, during a speech several weeks ago, called for more attention to the "real and persistent challenges" faced by women and girls of color, including lower incomes, higher rates of serious illness and more exposure to violence. The Obama administration last year launched a major initiative, "My Brother's Keeper," aimed at black boys and young men, and has been chided by some groups for not including girls and young women of color.  [Obama's call to lift up black women gets applause, but some want a specific plan]  Participants in Friday's forum will discuss a report, "Advancing Equity for Women and Girls of Color," that identifies several areas of focus, including education, criminal justice, health and economic conditions. In the area of education, the report calls for finding ways to reduce the disproportionately high rate of school suspension for girls of color, as well as encouraging more of them to study STEM fields.  The Ms. Foundation and Prosperity Together, a collaboration of 20 women's foundations, have pledged $100 million over five years to develop programs to lift women and girls out of poverty. The money could be used to provide job training, encourage women to open businesses or pay for child care so that women can go to work.  Another $18 million has been pledged by the Collaborative to Advance Equity through Research, which will study and collect data to help identify challenges faced by women and girls of color and solutions to those challenges. That effort will be led by the Anna Julia Cooper Center at Wake Forest University, which is co-hosting Friday's forum.  You can watch the forum here.',1
'HOW ‘REAL HOUSEWIVES’ HIT A NEW LOW WITH A BIZARRE ‘FAKE CANCER’ STORYLINE   Meghan Edmonds, Terry Dubrow, Brooks Ayers, Heather Dubrow, Vicki Gunvalson on ‘Real Housewives of Orange County.’ (Vivian Zink/Bravo)  (This is the 12th installment in a series that looks at the most fascinating, intriguing or just disturbing celebrity news of the week.)  (Note: This story has been updated with a statement from E!)  Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise has shown some crazy things. Like, “throwing a prosthetic leg across the room” crazy. This season, though, it hit a new low with fake cancer.  Yes, a sordid fake cancer scandal took over “Real Housewives of Orange County” Season 10, which technically wrapped last week with a third reunion show. However, the network decided to wring every last bit of drama and aired yet another follow-up on Thursday night called “Brooks Tells All.” It centered on Brooks Ayers (ex-boyfriend of cast member Vicki Gunvalson) insisting that he does have cancer, as he has done repeatedly for the past several months, even though everyone thinks he’s lying about being sick.  This has been a major storyline during the season, as the other women despise Ayers. One cast member, who went so far as to call Ayers’s doctor to fact-check, theorized on the show that he’s pretending to have cancer so he won’t have to pay child support. Ayers has repeatedly given detailed interviews about his cancer treatments and blames the the show for manufacturing a storyline around him. For what it’s worth, the “Brooks Tells All” special was filmed several weeks ago; in the meantime, Ayers has admitted he forged medical documents that supposedly proved he underwent chemotherapy. Still, he maintains that he has cancer and he’s keeping the real medical details to himself. (Bravo declined to elaborate on the Ayers situation.)  [What to expect on ‘The Real Housewives of Potomac’]  This is a convoluted mess, to say the least. And one has to wonder why Bravo or producers thought this was a good idea for a storyline. Everyone knows producers edit footage to create the most compelling plots; Ayers didn’t have to be a major part of the season. But apparently “possibly fake cancer” was too juicy to pass up to increase viewership, even if it is incredibly offensive – both to perpetrate a hoax like that, and frankly, to speculate that one exists.  “Millions of people are battling cancer and would give anything to be cured,” fumed Melanie Bromley, the E! News correspondent who interviewed Ayers when he supplied the fake medical documents. “What about the people who were in any way inspired by Brooks and his so-called candor?”  It’s a great point — except that E!, which shares a parent company with Bravo, was instrumental in pushing this story along. First, Bravo was so excited about this storyline that the very first trailer for the season showed cast members saying they didn’t believe Ayers had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as he claimed. Cast member Meghan Edmonds then teased her doubts to Star magazine, urging viewers to watch: “I believe the little questions that unfold will intrigue the audience,” she said.  Intrigue, offend, infuriate … what’s the difference? None, honestly, when it comes to reality television because viewers are viewers. But the whole situation became more cringeworthy when the controversy spilled into real life. After the season aired, E! started “investigating,” inviting Ayers on E! News for an interview in which he shared his side of the story and provided medical documents proving his chemotherapy treatments. Then, E! quickly published follow-up articles where they tore apart his claims, including a story boasting that they found “six inconsistencies exposed in his medical documents” from City of Hope hospital.  An E! spokesman said in a statement, “E! News is a news organization that investigates and reports on entertainment and pop culture stories independently.”  “Well, the truth is finally coming out tonight!” E! News co-host Jason Kennedy gleefully said on a broadcast this week. “We have exclusive proof that Brooks may have made the biggest lie in reality TV history.”  “I think he underestimated us here at E! News,” co-host Maria Menounos chimed in. “We did our homework.”  In other words, E! confirmed with the City of Hope that Ayers was never a patient. Bravo’s Web site quickly jumped on the story, citing E! and plugging the “Brooks Tells All” special. (Later, a City of Hope spokeswoman gave us the same statement and refused to answer any other questions.)  While it’s quite a coincidence that E! happened to land these details about a controversy going on over at its sister channel, Ayers eventually admitted to the network that he fabricated the medical documents so people would stop doubting him. “My sincerest apologies to my family, friends, loved ones, and those who are battling this horrid disease,” he said, insisting again that he does have cancer and the real details of his treatment will remain private. At this point, a spokeswoman for Ayers told us she advised her client against speaking to E! again, and after he did, she resigned from working with him.  On Thursday, Bravo’s “Brooks Tell All” special was also awkward. Ayers and Cohen battled back and forth on the details of Ayers’s health, with Ayers having an answer for every suspicious detail and Cohen looking on in disbelief. Ayers also blamed misunderstandings about his health on Gunvalson, whom he says didn’t always tell the truth.  Speaking of which, E! is also still going strong with stories, now looking at how Gunvalson could have lied and publishing reactions from the cast. (On the reunion, Gunvalson admitted to fabricating some details about Ayers to gain “compassion” from her friends.) Gunvalson, who broke up with Ayers in August after filming was completed, was originally furious that they questioned his integrity. “What does Brooks need to do? Die to prove everyone wrong?” she said in one episode. Now, she’s distancing herself from her ex, saying on Twitter that she’ll never speak to Ayers again and giving interviews saying how much she hates him, further fueling the gossip cycle.  Feeling queasy yet? While it’s one thing to have a salacious plot in a reality TV show, it’s another to center it on a deadly disease and drag it out into the real world, where people truly suffering from illness don’t need to see daily headlines about someone maybe faking cancer. As this whole stomach-turning situation continues to spin out of control, here’s hoping that a reality show doesn’t feel the need to go down this path again, no matter how many viewers that it tempts to bring.

'WHY MEN GET ALL THE CREDIT WHEN THEY WORK WITH WOMEN   Janet Yellen, Chair of the Federal Reserve, is married to Georgetown economist George Akerlof. In economist power couples, the women often get slighted by the press.(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)  When Princeton professor Angus Deaton co-authored a buzzed-about report this month on dying middle-aged whites, many journalists munged the order of the names. They mentioned Deaton first, as if it were mainly his paper, and not an equal collaboration with his wife.  There we go again.  Her name is Anne Case, and her name came first on the study. She’s a widely-respected professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton. But apparently, Case’s sterling credentials are no match for our unconscious biases.  The press might be forgiven for fixating on Angus Deaton, who won a Nobel Prize last month. But, as economist Justin Wolfers pointed out on Wednesday, the media has a nasty habit of treating female economists like second-class citizens. He noted several recent examples of journalists leaving women’s names as an afterthought.  Academics can be very sensitive about who receives credit for joint papers. In economics, there’s a convention that names on a paper go alphabetically, and collaborators contribute roughly the same amount of work. So, “Anne Case and Angus Deaton,” not the other way around. To switch the names would be unusual; it would imply that Deaton did the lion’s share of the work.  Wolfers blames gender stereotypes for spurring these (likely accidental) slights. “Close your eyes for a moment, and picture an economist,” he writes. “Odds are you pictured a man.”  But the bias is not just a failing of the press; economists themselves seem to systematically undervalue women’s contributions to group work.  Heather Sarsons, a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard, recently compiled four decades of records on over 500 tenure decisions at the top 30 economics schools in the nation. During the tenure process at a university, young professors race to do as much research as possible to prove they deserve a permanent position on the faculty. The number of papers they publish in journals is one important measure of their performance.  According to Sarson’s preliminary results, it doesn’t affect a male economist’s chances at tenure if he publishes papers on his own, or with collaborators. But female economists are punished if they co-author.  "When it's not clear who did the work, or who had the idea behind something, men seem to get more credit," Sarsons says.  In this chart from her paper, she shows that male economists get tenure about 75 percent of the time, regardless of whether they wrote most of their papers in groups, or solo. But women who co-author most of their papers only get tenure about 50 percent of the time. In contrast, women who solo-author most of their papers get tenure at about the same rate as men.  "While an additional coauthored paper increases the probability of receiving tenure," Sarsons writes in the paper, "it helps a man more than it helps a woman."  As further evidence that men are receiving credit for women's contributions, Sarsons shows that the penalty for co-authorship only exists when women work with men. When women work on a paper exclusively with other women, that penalty disappears. When men and women collaborate, however, men seem to soak up all the credit from the women.  One simple way to clear up any misunderstandings is to order the names according to who did the most work. That's the convention in most fields, including sociology, which Sarsons also analyzed for her study. The work is still in progress, but so far, Sarsons finds that there is no co-authorship penalty for women in sociology. It's possible that sociology, which has many more women than economics, is simply less biased. But it's also likely no coincidence that sociology papers clearly indicate who gets more credit.  In economics papers, the ambiguity about credit that seems to offer fertile ground for unconscious (or conscious) bias -- sometimes with less provocative implications. This has led to another weird phenomenon — economists with names that are earlier in the alphabet tend to be over-represented at top economics departments, and they are more likely to win prestigious prizes, according to economists Liran Einav and Leeat Yariv. At the top 5 economics departments, having a name one letter closer to the start of the alphabet makes you one percent more likely to get tenure.  By dint of orthography, these early-alphabet names are the ones most likely to be listed first on a paper. Even though being the first author is meaningless in economics, there do exist some benefits. It's the first author whose name shows up in indexes and bibliographies. In the interest of brevity, journalists often mention a paper by the name of the first author only. Einav and Yariv point out that the pattern of alphabetical advantage doesn't exist in psychology, where authors are listed by size of their contributions.  Bias, in other words, shows up in the darnedest places. But economics is particularly notorious among the social sciences for bias against women. Women are less likely to get tenure, and less likely to get promoted to full professor. "It's something systemic to the field," Harvard economist Claudia Goldin said to the Richmond Fed's magazine in 2013.  Sarsons's research may explain some of the sexism in economics by pointing out another way that women may be discriminated against. The idea is broader than that, though. Whenever women work in groups with men, it's possible that their contributions might be discounted.  The funny thing is that research shows women make groupwork a lot more efficient, in part because they're on average better at reading people's emotions. Women also tend to prefer working collaboratively. Yet, for all their contributions to the team, experiments also show that women are less likely to and claim their rightful share of the credit, particularly when their teammates are men.  Economics offers a real-world example of what happens when it's unclear who gets credit for what. People assume — and women seem to lose out.  Right now, Sarsons is surveying female economists to find out if they have personally noticed this phenomenon, and if they have become wary of working with men as a result. In her own paper, Sarsons seems to have taken the lesson to heart.  "This paper is intentionally solo-authored," she writes in a footnote.',1
'‘APPOMATTOX’: A SUPERB NIGHT AT THE OPERA. Tom Fox portrays President Abraham Lincoln in Act 1 of Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton’s opera “Appomattox.” “We have Abraham Lincoln in the first act and LBJ in the second act,” Glass says. “I don’t know that there were any greater presidents between those two.” Fox also portrays LBJ in Act 2.  Tom Fox portrays President Abraham Lincoln in Act 1 of Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton’s opera “Appomattox.” “We have Abraham Lincoln in the first act and LBJ in the second act,” Glass says. “I don’t know that there were any greater presidents between those two.” Fox also portrays LBJ in Act 2. Matt McClain/The Washington Post  Something important happened at the Kennedy Center on Saturday night, and it was an opera called “Appomattox.”  Another opera of that name, by Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton, had its world premiere in San Francisco in 2007. The opera that the Washington National Opera opened on Saturday is also called “Appomattox,” and is also by Glass and Hampton, but it’s a complete revision of the first opera, with an entirely new second act. And although I didn’t see the opera in San Francisco, I can say that if you didn’t see this Act II, which manages to bring Martin Luther King and LBJ and their contemporaries to musical life without being stilted or preachy or eye-rolling, and which sears across the stage like a firework of light and color and rage and pain and beauty, then you haven’t yet really seen “Appomattox.”  Forget what you think you know about Philip Glass — or remember it and wonder, because the score is unmistakably Glass without having many of the traits detractors tend to associate with the composer. You can certainly hear those so-called Minimalist patterns going on in the orchestra, taxing the players’ fingers with their repetitions, but in the service of raw operatic emotion, underneath incisive and dramatic vocal writing. And you can certainly say there’s something film-like about this opera by a composer who’s written a number of film scores, but film-like in the sense of being so engrossing that you are pulled in without fully remembering where you are — something that happens a lot more often in film than in contemporary opera.  Glass is one of the most prolific and most-performed opera composers working today — he’s written 27 of them. “Appomattox” shows he’s attained mastery in the genre — and is, of those I’ve seen, by far the most moving.  [Gallery: The faces of “Appomattox”]  What happened, I think, is that the revisions got to the heart of what Hampton and Glass actually wanted to say. The original “Appomattox,” largely preserved in Act I, is about the Civil War, and is plenty colorful itself as it outlines the events leading up to the honorably worked-out truce that ended the war and freed the slaves. It starts with an opening vignette of a chorus of black soldiers singing “Tenting tonight on the old camp ground,” spread across the proscenium like a widescreen film in Tazewell Thompson’s production, followed by an ensemble of intertwining women’s voices as Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant, Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Lincoln’s dressmaker, sing “war is sorrowful,” which though lovely is the nearest the opera gets to cliché.  The meat of the act, though, are the exchanges between Lincoln (Tom Fox) and Frederick Douglass (Soloman Howard) at Lincoln’s second inaugural, when Douglass demands the vote for black citizens; and between Robert E. Lee (David Pittsinger) and Ulysses S. Grant (Richard Paul Fink), standing before large Confederate and Union flags as they correspond with each other before the signing of the truce that ended the war and freed the slaves, leaving Pittsinger’s statuesque Lee, resonant of voice and nuanced of acting, honorable in defeat.  But some of the poignancy of Act I stems from the fact that the good hopes and intentions of that truce were dashed, and in the opera’s first version, that wasn’t fully spelled out. Hampton went back and reworked the libretto into a play that incorporated the Civil Rights era; and Glass was eager to revise the opera as well. And the new material moves away the historical screen and reveals more about the creators themselves.  [Read more: The war that would not end: in “Appomattox,” race relations take the opera stage]  If you ever questioned the ability of Glass’s music to be emotional, the searing, swelling music in Act II around Johnson’s astonishingly powerful nationally broadcast message to Congress (“it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome”), should convince you. Not to mention the 2011 epilogue in which Edgar Ray Killen (Pittsinger, magisterial again), jailed for the 1964 killings of three civil rights workers, graphically describes their deaths as the music loses its patterns and explodes into angry wordless jabberings of rage. (Dante Santiago Anzolini, the conductor, deserves extra praise for pulling off a solid performance after learning this score on a few days’ notice when Dennis Russell Davies, who was scheduled to conduct, injured himself in a fall and was forced to cancel just before the start of rehearsals.)  And it’s no longer enough for Glass simply to incorporate the music of the past: with his own original version of “Glory, Glory Hallelujah” at the end of one of Martin Luther King’s speeches, he rewrites it, movingly.  What’s astonishing is how naturally and fluidly all this material allows itself to be depicted operatically. It perhaps comes as no surprise that Martin Luther King is a natural operatic figure, and Soloman Howard, young, charismatic, and vocally imposing with a rumble-the-floorboards bass, does him justice. But LBJ is profane, quirky, and given to using the toilet during official meetings (yes, it’s in the opera), and that both the work and Fox, singing his second president of the night, remain true to the historical record and the historical flavor of Johnson is something of a tour de force. And simply hearing the rage and pain of black civil rights activists front and center on stage, starting with the chorus that opens the act, might alone be enough to establish this as a significant opera, even if the choral writing weren’t so effective.  Thompson, the director, does a fine job keeping the narrative clear and moving on a relatively simple two-story set, and helping to develop an unusually rich collection of characters. Standouts among the really wonderful cast, apart from those already mentioned, included Melody Moore, who sang Mrs. Grant and Vi Liuzzo, a civil rights volunteer, with a clear shining voice; Chrystal E. Williams as Elizabeth Keckley and Coretta Scott King; Aleksey Bogdanov with a pitch-perfect oiliness as George Wallace; Anne-Carolyn Bird as the two first ladies, and Frederick Ballentine. Ballentine sang some of the most painful arias in the opera: a description of the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a civil rights activist, in Act II, and an account of the Colfax massacre of 1873, in which dozens of black men were slaughtered in cold blood.  Hampton’s libretto is an artful adaptation of his play, adding some choral and ensemble scenes that wouldn’t work in spoken theater and that also underline the parallels between the two acts. A pendant to the Colfax massacre epilogue to Act I is the epilogue to Act II, in which Pittsinger’s unrepentant Killen voices the hatred and threat that persists today. But as that sinister episode died away, the women returned to the stage, one by one, in an ensemble pleading for an end to sorrow and a rejection of racism and prejudice. It is as deeply moving as anything I’ve seen in opera. This opera runs for only a week; I will certainly be going again, and I think everybody should see it.  Appomattox runs through Nov. 22 at the Kennedy Center Opera House.',0
'COULD UTERUS TRANSPLANTS SOLVE INFERTILITY FOR SOME U.S. WOMEN? Mother playing with son. (Photo: Jupiterimages, Getty Images/Creatas RF)  A team of doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will soon begin implanting uteruses into women who were born without them.  The research study will involve ten women who have uterine factor infertility or cannot carry a child because they were born without a uterus; the Cleveland Clinic announced Thursday, The New York Times reported.  The announcement comes almost a year after doctors in Sweden reported that a woman successfully delivered a baby boy after she received a uterus implant. The then 35-year-old woman was born without a uterus and received the implant in 2013 from a 61-year-old post-menopausal woman, according to research published in the journal The Lancet.  The birth offered the first “proof-of-concept for uterus transplantation as a treatment for uterine factor infertility,” according to the report. Since the first transplant, the Swedish group has implanted nine uteruses that resulted in four live births, according to a statement from the Cleveland Clinic.  UFI affects thousands of women worldwide. Some women are born without a uterus and others can acquire UFI after a hysterectomy or a serious pelvic infection, according to the clinic.  “Women who are coping with UFI have few existing options,” Tommaso Falcone, a Cleveland Clinic doctor working on the study said in statement. “Although adoption and surrogacy provide opportunities for parenthood, both pose logistical challenges and may not be acceptable due to personal, cultural or legal reasons.”  The screening process for the study began in September.  A pool of 21-to-39-year-old women with UFI faced medical and psychological evaluations from experts at the clinic before they were admitted to the study, according to the statement.  Treating UFI with uterine transplantation is still "considered highly experimental,” Falcone said in a statement. He said the study will "explore the feasibility of this approach for women in the United States.”  The successful transplants in the Swedish study offer hope that the U.S. study will also result in the delivery of "healthy infants," Andreas Tzakis, Cleveland Clinic lead investigator, said in a statement. Tzakis said the implants are unlike other organ implants in that the purpose they serve does not last a lifetime.  “They are ‘ephemeral,’” he says. “They are not intended to last for the duration of the recipient’s life, but will be maintained for only as long as is necessary to produce one or two children.”',1
'WOMEN PERFORMED COMPARABLY TO MEN IN RANGER SCHOOL 1st Lt. Shaye Haver is one of the first women to pass Ranger School and earn the Ranger Tab. (Photo: Robin Trimarchi, Army)  Just days before completing his tenure, Army Secretary John McHugh defended the service’s decision to open its Ranger School to women and outlined data that showed female candidates performed just as well — and in some cases better than — their male peers.  McHugh was responding to allegations the Army eased the standards for the first women to complete the famously grueling course.  Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla., a retired lieutenant colonel and Ranger graduate, in September asked the Army to release documents relating to the performance of the first female students in Ranger School.  In an Oct. 20 letter to Russell, McHugh wrote that most student records are not retained after graduation. Instead, in a practice dating to 1952, the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade keeps a Ranger student's "Green Card," which verifies their attempt or successful completion of the course.  McHugh, who stepped down as secretary Nov. 1, likened it to a university transcript, which does not include "every test or paper that a student completes within a course."  "The Army takes exception to your characterization of this standard operating procedure as demonstrating a 'lack of due care' or the implication that this practice is somehow nefarious in either deed or motive," McHugh wrote in the letter, provided to Army Times by Russell's office.  Russell is working with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Armed Services Committee to obtain the records, according to a source in the congressman's office.  McHugh, in his letter, said the Army's gender-integrated assessment and subsequent opening of Ranger School was a decision "to allow women the opportunity to prove their own abilities within the Ranger course."

Shaye Haver, both West Point graduates, made history on Aug. 21 by becoming the first women to graduate from the storied Ranger School.  Maj. Lisa Jaster graduated on Oct. 16.  The women were part of a gender-integrated assessment of the school, which until earlier this year had been open only to men. In all, 19 women started Ranger School in April. Griest, Haver and Jaster were the only ones to complete the course.  Critics have for months accused the Army of lowering the standards of Ranger School or giving the female students an unfair advantage by allowing them multiple attempts at the school's three phases.  The Army on Sept. 2 announced that Ranger School is now open to all qualified soldiers regardless of gender. The first integrated class since that announcement kicked off Nov.2. The five women who started the course did not qualify to move on past the Ranger Assessment Phase, according to media reports.',1

'STUDENT PROGRAMMER WINS CERN OPENLAB INTERNSHIP The Large Hadron Collider at CERN. (Photo: CERN)  If you were tasked with choosing the ultimate grand prize for a young coder, what would it be?  A million dollars? Nah. Lunch with PC pioneer Bill Gates? Ho-hum. A job at Facebook? Meh.  Instead, it would likely be an internship at CERN openlab, one of – if not -- the most celebrated scientific research centers on the planet.  Based in Geneva, CERN houses the world’s largest particle physics lab, including its underground Large Hadron Collider (LHC), plus it’s the birthplace of the World Wide Web and home to CERN openlab, a renowned facility that encourages experimentation and collaboration to solve data-intensive challenges.  Mathieu Gravey, a 25 year-old PhD student in France, has won this coveted grand prize from the Intel Modern Code Developer Challenge, in partnership with CERN openlab.  “This is very, very exciting,” says Gravey, in a Skype video interview with USA TODAY. “It’s the opportunity for me to enter and work in one of the most famous international research centers.”  “I hope to meet interesting scientists, while acquiring and developing new skills under them,” adds Gravey. “Data analytics and simulation through cutting edge technologies are key fields of study for years to come.”  The challenge  Available only to students, this international coding contest challenged students to optimize code used to simulate brain development.  In particular, the software focuses on simulating the development of a normal and diseased brain, in order to identify the causes and potential treatments for neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.  This code is part of an existing CERN openlab research project, in collaboration with Newcastle University in the UK, which uses a “parallel programming” framework to help accelerate research among multiple scientists.  Students who entered the Intel Modern Code Developer Challenge were tasked with optimizing the code to improve its runtime performance, allowing researchers to make life-changing scientific breakthroughs faster.  Out of the roughly 2,000 students, representing 130-odd universities across 19 countries, Gravey submitted the fastest optimized code to win the 9-week internship at CERN openlab in 2016.  “Brain simulation is very interesting and it might be the future of informatics,” says Gravey. “Nowadays, smart processes are developing faster than ever before; the link between computer and biology is also getting stronger.”  Gravey maintains his biggest challenge was “diving into code that you haven’t written, plus this kind of algorithm is out of my field of study. These optimizations were performed through an iterative process.”  Perhaps he’s just being modest: according to Intel, Gravey improved the performance of the code by a whopping 32,000 percent -- from 45 hours to just over 8 minutes.  While the internship was the Grand Prize, 1st place winners earned a trip for a guided tour of CERN, while 2nd place winners get a trip to the 2016 Supercomputing Conference in Austin, Texas, where all winners were announced at this year’s event on Saturday.  The impact  “Young people bring new perspectives, enthusiasm and sources of inspiration to the technical development program,” says Maria Girone, who leads multiple experimental programs at CERN, which spans across more than 70 computing centers on five continents.  “The CERN openlab summer student program is an excellent way to train the next generation of computer scientists, some of whom will join CERN for longer periods of time -- as technical students, fellows or staff, for instance -- to tackle future challenges,” says Girone, who will take over the role of CERN openlab Chief Technology Officer beginning in January.  CERN openlab’s current CTO Fons Rademakers says partners like Intel give CERN’s scientists early access to tomorrow’s technology. “And for our partners, the testing and feedback provided by running their prototypes in CERN’s demanding environment can help correct possible design mistakes and help improve or better understand the product.”  “The CERN openlab summer student program brings young undergraduate students in contact with the latest and most advanced technologies, but also lets them work for nine weeks in a fast-paced, high-intensity, international environment, among world renowned scientists and engineers.”',0
'HRT COULD BENEFIT ONE MILLION WOMEN, SAYS NHS MENOPAUSE GUIDANCE NHS guidance on treatment of the menopause could lead to many thousands more women being offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the UK.  Related: A guide to the menopause  The guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), unveiled on Thursday, seeks to reassure women and their GPs about the safety of HRT. Studies suggesting a link with breast cancer, published in 2002 and 2003, led to a halving of the numbers of women taking the drugs.    Nice says the guideline could benefit more than a million women, many of whom could be prescribed HRT as the most effective treatment for debilitating symptoms, which include hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia and mood swings. The aim, says Nice, is for women to not suffer in silence and feel able to discuss their options with their doctor or practice nurse and make an informed decision.  Cancer scientists, however, have expressed concern that the effect of the guideline might be to rehabilitate HRT without sufficient recognition of the long-term potential harm. Prof Valerie Beral, an Oxford epidemiologist who leads the Million Women study which linked HRT to breast and ovarian cancer, told the Guardian that the risks were clear.  “About one million UK women are currently using hormones for the menopause,” she said. “Among them, about 10,000 extra breast cancers are estimated to occur in the next 10 years [40,000 in total, instead of 30,000 if the women had not used the hormones]. Also about 1,000 extra ovarian cancers are estimated to occur among them in the next 10 years [6,000 in total].”  Related: HRT media campaign underplays cancer risks, critics say  The Nice guideline committee says that women should be able to make up their own minds as to whether the benefits of relieving menopause symptoms would outweigh any potential risks. GPs or practice nurses should explain the risks, taking into account a woman’s individual circumstances. For example, breast cancer risks rise for those who are overweight or drink regularly.  “Women can cope with lots of side effects as long as they know about them,” said Prof Mary Ann Lumsden, chair of the committee. “The thing that really bothers them is if they haven’t been told.”    Dr Imogen Shaw, a GP with a special interest in gynaecology on the committee, said many women’s needs were not being met. “There are still a lot of women out there who have no idea there is any treatment.”  Shaw said women have told her of having to get up twice in the night to change the sheets, which are soaked with sweat, and of setting off for work after a shower, having dried their hair, only to arrive with a wet scalp and make-up running down their face. “If this is interfering with your life and you are not coping with these symptoms, go and talk to your GP or a practice nurse,” she said.  Related: What women should know about menopause  The guideline is the first on the menopause, which women go through at an average age of 51. An estimated 1.5 million women, around 80% of those experiencing the menopause, have some symptoms and 20% suffer more severely. One woman in 100 experiences a premature menopause before the age of 40. Those women would particularly benefit from hormonal therapy, Nice says.  It advises that tests for hormone levels to establish whether women over 45 have reached the menopause should be discontinued as they are unreliable and a waste of money. It says women who have had breast cancer and have menopausal symptoms should be referred to a specialist to see what treatment is suitable for them.  According to Nice, there are treatments other than HRT than can alleviate some, but not all, of the symptoms. These include cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for low mood. The guideline says antidepressants should not be given unless a woman has a diagnosis of depression. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as black cohosh and St John’s wort can help with some symptoms, but they warn that they do not come in standard preparations and that they can interact with other medicines.  The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which licenses drugs in the UK, recommends that the lowest effective dose of HRT should be given to women for the shortest possible time – advice Nice repeats.    Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, spokesperson for the Royal College of GPs, said the guideline would be very helpful to health professionals. “Many women are understandably concerned about the link that has been made between HRT and increased risk of breast cancer and other conditions, such as thromboembolism,” she said. “But it is important to remember that these issues are closely related to prolonged use of HRT in older women and these risks reduce substantially after treatment is stopped.  “Ultimately, any decision to prescribe HRT needs to come out of a discussion between GPs and individual patients about their unique circumstances, the pros and cons of treatments, and how to achieve the best possible health outcome.”  Dr Claire Knight, Cancer Research UK’s health information manager, said: “We know that using hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing breast, ovarian and in some cases womb cancer, but HRT can also offer effective relief from menopausal symptoms.  “What these new guidelines from Nice reiterate is that there are many factors at play in a woman’s choice to use HRT or not and women need clear, evidence-based information around the risks and benefits to help them make an informed decision. If you are considering starting or stopping HRT, speak with your doctor.”  ',1
'LEADING MEXICO CITY WOMEN DRAW UP 'MANIFESTO' TO IMPROVE THE CITY FOR ALL Political analyst Denise Dresser at the Frida Kahlo Museum  Tackling gender-based violence and unsafe public spaces are the main priorities for women in Mexico City, according to a diverse group of distinguished women who were invited to take part in a special discussion by the Guardian.  The group – which included actors, singers, political analysts, human rights activists, journalists and students who live and work in Mexico City – debated the biggest issues and challenges facing women in 2015. The event was held in the garden of Casa Azul where Kahlo, arguably one of the world’s most influential feminists and female artists, lived and created some of her best-known work.  The group agreed a list of priorities that will be presented by the Guardian to Patricia Mercado, secretariat of the Mexico City government. Mercado, a high-profile feminist politician and former presidential candidate, is one of the highest ranking female officials serving in the city government.  Guests at the ‘Mexico City for women’ discussion at the Frida Kahlo Museum.  The recommendations (which are not the official views of the Frida Kahlo Museum) urge authorities to develop and implement effective public campaigns targeting school children and adults, to help promote gender equality and to eradicate sexual harassment – which the group said is widespread in workplaces and public spaces, especially public transport.  Safe public meeting places, self-defence classes and better-lit streets are practical steps the city authorities could take immediately to improve security for women, the group concluded.    List of recommendations for the city  • The city’s government has a key role in promoting positive role models through its public campaigns, through equal gender representation in all spheres of public life, and by ensuring that there are safe public spaces for women to live, work and meet, within includes well-lit streets and safe transport operating to even the most marginalised areas.  • Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. Our panel seeks urgent action to tackle society’s tolerance of the harassment of women – in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity – and to challenge women’s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media.    • The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human-rights defenders – for example, the massacre in Navarte – must be a priority for the city’s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.  Actor Eréndira Ibarra speaking at the Frida Kahlo Museum  • Violence in the city, which includes feminicide and trafficking with Mexico City as a destination, must be acknowledged as a serious problem affecting women in the capital. Crimes against women must be investigated and prosecuted as laid out in legislation. Impunity must end, and victims must not be blamed, for example in the case of the member of staff who was killed in the Liverpool department store last November.    • Additionally, women feel too afraid to report crime, so there should be specially trained teams in the Public Ministry where women can go to report crimes with confidence.  • Women will never be safe while impunity continues. The city government should implement a zero-tolerance approach, starting with its own workforce, so that perpetrators – regardless of the seriousness of their crime – are brought to justice in a transparent and timely fashion.  • The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled – and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards.  • There are almost 250,000 domestic workers in Mexico City, more than 90% of them women. Yet almost none have contracts and, as such, no access to social security or security of work. The vast majority are not from Mexico City, many are indigenous women, and they suffer verbal, physical and sometimes sexual abuse.    • The consensus is that Mexico City should be a role model for the rest of the country, and the laws and policies towards equality which already exist must be implemented as a matter of urgency.

'STEVEN SPIELBERG’S BRIDGE OF SPIES – AND THE ROLE OUR FATHER PLAYED It is unusual for a woman of 66 to go to the cinema nine times to watch the latest Hollywood spy thriller, even if it stars Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance and is directed by Steven Spielberg. But when the film is a celebration of a forgotten moment of glory for a much loved father, it is easier to understand.  “I feel like my father has been in the shadows and is finally emerging,” Mary Ellen Donovan Fuller told the Observer. “The scene that means most to me personally is when Dad comes home and collapses on his bed with exhaustion. He really poured his life into his exploits.”  Bridge of Spies, out in the UK in November, tells the true story of the secret cold war negotiations that eventually led to the East German release of two Americans on a snowy bridge in Berlin in 1962.  The central character, James Donovan – Fuller’s late father, who is played by Hanks – is the Brooklyn insurance lawyer asked to defend a Soviet spy, Colonel Rudolf Abel, played by Rylance, who had been caught living undercover in New York. The decision to take up Abel’s unpopular case drew Donovan into a complex and covert world of international dealing in which his skills as an independent negotiator came to be relied on by the American government.  Bridge of Spies has already earned rave reviews, including five stars from the Guardian and plaudits from the New Yorker. The screenplay is by British playwright Matt Charman, who brought the story to Spielberg’s DreamWorks studios. His final script is a collaboration with Joel and Ethan Coen, and was inspired by Donovan’s book, Strangers on a Bridge, re-published last month.  The lawyer’s children, also portrayed in the film, now believe their crusade to win recognition for their father is over at last. For Fuller’s sister, Jan Amorosi, 72, the sight of Hanks playing their father on screen – struggling against the chill of the diplomatic climate and an icy winter in Berlin – proved too much. “I lost him when I was a young girl, so to see the harshness of the conditions he had to put up with, I started to cry and I couldn’t stop for about 20 minutes,” she said this weekend. “So many years of missing him. That shows the film has been well done, I suppose. It is very welcome and very overdue. He was a forgotten man.”  Amorosi, who is played in the film by Eve Hewson – the daughter of U2’s Bono – loves the film, although she pointed out that, while her family were verbally abused for supposed “Commie” sympathies, they were never victims of a violent attack, as portrayed in the film.  She recalls her father considering the job of defending Abel, a national bogeyman: “After he took the call he went outside to hit some golf balls, then came back into the house and said, ‘I am taking the case’. He was very decisive and liked challenges. But, of course, that was the beginning of all the trouble for us.”  Much of the plot chimes with her memories, such as the day in Brooklyn just before Donovan was called out to Berlin to oversee the spy exchange, when she noticed him rubbing his palms together nervously. “He was giving me a lift in the car and I asked what was going on. He admitted he was excited about something.” Later, staying in the Adirondack mountains with friends, the young Amorosi received a call from the CIA promising to take her to meet her father in a safe house in Washington as soon as he got back.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Donovan.  Her brother John, a 70-year-old Vietnam veteran from Connecticut, also remembers the secrecy. All the family, including their mother, Mary, were told Donovan was golfing in Scotland. “Before he went to Berlin he spent a few nights in London. I was at boarding school at the time and in a bit of trouble. But he sent me a note from Claridge’s hotel that he must have written right before he flew to Berlin. He told me I should relax and that things would work out. It was good advice.”  A little older than depicted in the film and, he said, less sceptical than portrayed, the son even accompanied his father on visits to Abel in jail.  “My father always explained Abel was ‘really all about Mother Russia’. He was an introverted type of person. We once sang him a version of the Christmas song with the words ‘Rudolf, the red-faced spy’. He laughed only a little and then talked about something else,” he said.  Donovan was so keen to see his father’s work acknowledged that he once wrote his own screenplay. “I kept running into dead ends, so I was delighted to hear from Charman and DreamWorks,” he said.  The children all gave Charman a sense of their father’s fair, but tough, approach. “He always wanted to get down to basics,” said his son. “In the beginning of the movie he is shown talking about a certain insurance case that actually came to the Supreme Court later in his career. Multiple liability in a road traffic case was the issue and I remember, because I was there, that he did hold up a newspaper headline and say, ‘It says there that one accident happened, not three’.”  Fuller, who lives in South Carolina, was “mesmerised by how much they captured my father”. “He had a great sense of irony and I love the fact it is a numbers game throughout the movie.”  For her elder sister, the film’s climactic scene on the Berlin bridge sums up her father’s trustworthy nature. When Rylance, the Soviet spy, steps from the car, he sees Donovan and is reassured.  “Back then we got a phone call from a representative in the middle of the night. Because it was all hush hush, my mother was confused. The CIA had even sent us postcards from Scotland,” said Amorosi. “When someone said we must be proud of my father, my baffled mother said, ‘Why? Did he get a hole-in-one?’”  Donovan was once to have been played by Gregory Peck, after his success playing lawyer Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird. Peter Ustinov had written a screenplay and Alec Guinness was to play Abel.  “My father and I were in London and we spent three days with Peck there, since he was filming Arabesque with Sophia Loren,” said Fuller. “He guided me privately through London Zoo one night!”  The family had already seen Donovan handle a secondment to the Office of Strategic Services, the American wartime intelligence operation, and a period in charge of visual evidence at the war crime trials at Nuremberg. His later career, before an early death at the age of 53 in 1970, was no less dramatic. Donovan negotiated with Fidel Castro for the release of prisoners during the Bay of Pigs crisis in 1961.  After nine cinema trips to Bridge of Spies, his youngest child is still not ruling out another. “I love going to the movie theatre to see my father on the big screen, before it joins the ranks of all the other films out there,” Fuller said.',0
'NEPAL: LAWMAKERS ELECT NATION’S FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Members of Parliament on Wednesday elected a veteran campaigner for women’s rights, Bidhya Devi Bhandari, to be the country’s first female president.

'UNDER PRESSURE, FEMININE PRODUCT MAKERS DISCLOSE INGREDIENTS Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dressed as a box of Tampax tampons, Stephanie Phillips, a 30-year-old vegan chef, danced on the sidewalk outside Procter & Gamble’s headquarters in Cincinnati.          Ms. Phillips and a small group of demonstrators were protesting the company’s use of chemicals in its feminine care products, much to the chagrin of the investors who were filing into the annual shareholder meeting.  “I think it’s really messed up that Procter & Gamble’s putting chemicals in feminine products and not letting anyone know about it,” Ms. Phillips said.  Consumer products companies may have been able to ignore these kinds of displays in the not-so-distant past. Now, however, health advocates can use social media platforms and other tools to galvanize public support — not just from demonstrators like Ms. Phillips, but from customers who can boycott a company’s products.  The increased pressure to respond to public concern has yielded some results.  Within the last few weeks, P.&G. and its rival Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kotex pads and tampons, began posting online the ingredients in their feminine hygiene products. While both companies list tampon ingredients on their packages, neither lists the ingredients for their pads on the packaging. P.&G. expanded the information it offered about the inclusion of synthetic materials, while Kimberly-Clark disclosed ingredients in its tampon applicators.  P.&G. also agreed to meet with Women’s Voices for the Earth after the group’s protest outside the shareholder meeting on Oct. 13.  The group had come armed with more than just costumes and banners: 35,000 people had signed a petition demanding that P.&.G. disclose feminine care ingredients and remove certain chemicals. The group had also created a spoof video as part of its campaign that has garnered more than 60,000 views online, according to its executive director, Erin Switalski.  “We had been trying to get a meeting with the company for a couple of years and they hadn’t been responding to our requests,” Ms. Switalski said. “If we aren’t able to get a dialogue, then we have to use some of these public pressure tactics to get these meetings to take place.”  Blogs, Facebook and Twitter have helped advocates like Ms. Switalski spread the word about their concerns. But manufacturers often grumble that public criticism of individual ingredients is not always justified, and forces them to make costly and time-consuming changes.  P.&G. and Kimberly-Clark say that their products are safe, and undergo rigorous scientific testing before they reach store shelves. And both companies say that transparency is a priority.  Photo  “Everything we do starts with the consumer,” a P.&G. spokesman, Damon Jones, said in an email. “It’s a balancing act — sharing enough to be helpful, but not too much that it is confusing.”  P.&.G. and Kimberly-Clark together account for the largest share of the more than $3 billion worth of tampons, panty liners and feminine wipes sold in North America last year, according to data from Euromonitor, a market research firm.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  While toxic shock syndrome is the best-known illness associated with tampons, advocates like Ms. Switalski are now more concerned with chemicals linked to cancer and allergies. Manufacturers have largely moved away from the ingredients linked to toxic shock syndrome since so-called superabsorbent products created a public health concern in the 1970s and 1980s.  The Food and Drug Administration still receives reports of illness relating to tampons, but says that instances of toxic shock syndrome are “rare.”  Some experts, like Dr. Philip M. Tierno, a professor of microbiology and pathology at New York University School of Medicine, argue that cotton tampons are preferable to those that use viscose rayon in the core. “Rayon” and “rayon fibers” are listed among the ingredients in some products on P.&G. and Kimberly-Clark’s websites.  “Even though viscose was the least of the bad superabsorbent ingredients, it’s still significant to some people,” he said. About four years ago, Dr. Tierno said he testified against a manufacturer in court in the case of a woman who lost all of her limbs because of toxic shock syndrome.  On its website, the F.D.A. says that “tampons made with rayon do not appear to have a higher risk of T.S.S. than cotton tampons of similar absorbency.”  But while the agency monitors certain chemicals linked to toxic shock syndrome and other ingredients, health advocates say that more oversight is needed, in part because companies are not required to disclose all the components that go into their raw materials.  Fragrances can be particularly problematic for consumers seeking more detailed information about their personal care products. Many personal care products companies simply list “fragrance” as an ingredient. (P.&G. describes it as “like those found in other women’s products.”)  Fragrances, however, can be made up of dozens of undisclosed chemicals that worry consumer advocates. Women’s Voices for the Earth says it found chemicals including styrene and chloroform in several of P.&G.’s feminine napkins.  Mr. Jones, the P.&G. spokesman, said the company disputed the group’s testing methodology, and he said that many of the chemicals listed in the report were commonly found in the environment.  Manufacturers say that their use of chemicals always falls well within safe exposure limits. But Ms. Switalski and others say that certain chemicals should not be included in products at all.  Complicating matters is the fact that companies often source fragrances from third-party suppliers, who guard their formulations closely.  Still, some companies have gone further than others: In June, SC Johnson, the maker of Glade, disclosed some of the most common fragrance ingredients used in more than 200 of its air fresheners, candles and scented oils.  “The new disclosures from Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark are a step in the right direction, and show that the concerns expressed by millions of women are being heard,” Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement. “But these disclosures are still very limited.”  For more than a decade, Ms. Maloney has pushed Congress to approve further research on feminine hygiene products. This year, she reintroduced a version of the same bill she introduced in 1997, that would direct the National Institutes of Health to study ingredients in tampons and other products.',1
'THE WAR ON CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT GOES DIGITAL Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As the problem of sexual assault on college campuses has become a hot-button issue for school administrators and federal education regulators, one question keeps coming up: Why don’t more students report attacks?          According to a recent study of 27 schools, about one-quarter of female undergraduates and students who identified as queer or transgender said they had experienced nonconsensual sex or touching since entering college, but most of the students said they did not report it to school officials or support services.  Some felt the incidents weren’t serious enough. Others said they did not think anyone would believe them or they feared negative social consequences. Some felt it would be too emotionally difficult.  Now, in an effort to give students additional options — and to provide schools with more concrete data — a nonprofit software start-up in San Francisco called Sexual Health Innovations has developed an online reporting system for campus sexual violence.  Students at participating colleges can use its site, called Callisto, to record details of an assault anonymously. The site saves and time-stamps those records. That allows students to decide later whether they want to formally file reports with their schools — identifying themselves by their school-issued email addresses — or download their information and take it directly to the police. The site also offers a matching system in which a user can elect to file a report with the school electronically only if someone else names the same assailant.  Callisto’s hypothesis is that some college students — who already socialize, study and shop online — will be more likely initially to document a sexual assault on a third-party site than to report it to school officials on the phone or in person.  “If you have to walk into a building to report, you can only go at certain times of day and you’re not certain who you have to talk to, how many people you have to talk to, what they will ask,” Jessica Ladd, the nonprofit’s founder and chief executive, said in a recent interview in New York. “Whereas online, you can fill out a form at any time of day or night from anywhere and push a button.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Callisto is part of a wave of apps and sites that tackle different facets of the sexual assault problem on campus. Some colleges and universities have introduced third-party mobile apps that enable students to see maps of local crime hot spots, report suspicious activity, request a ride from campus security services or allow their friends to track their movements virtually as they walk home. Many schools now ask students to participate in online or in-person training programs that present different situations involving sexual assault, relationship violence and issues of consent.  Institutions of higher learning are increasingly starting such programs to comply with statutes like Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by education programs that receive federal funding. Much of that activity comes in response to a letter issued in 2011 by the Department of Education that said colleges must create campuses free of sexual violence or face possible penalties. Schools are also trying to manage the reputational risks posed by students who accuse administrators of mishandling their sexual assault cases. As of Nov. 4, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights was investigating 175 cases involving sexual violence at 146 postsecondary schools.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some of the emerging tools seem like digital updates of “blue light” poles, the campus phone stations that college students have used for years to summon help or report an emergency — often after a problem has already occurred.  But Callisto presents itself as a more advanced reporting system that is particularly sensitive to students experiencing trauma. Ms. Ladd said she came up with the idea for a web-based reporting system after she was assaulted as an undergraduate at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.  “I went through the reporting process and found it disempowering and retraumatizing,” she said. “I started thinking about what would have been helpful.”  So far, the site has raised nearly $400,000 from Google.org, Google’s philanthropic arm, and other donors. This semester, two schools — Pomona College and the University of San Francisco — are testing Callisto. And a handful of students at the University of San Francisco have already used the site to file reports to school authorities.  But even if students choose not to officially submit their information, the site plans to share aggregated data to help administrators identify patterns and trends that could inform their prevention efforts.  “I think it could be helpful to see if there are reports on specific dates, if there are reports after certain events in San Francisco or on campus,” says Julie Orio, the interim vice provost of student life at the University of San Francisco.  The site also illustrates some challenges that start-ups may face in trying to apply insights from consumer behavior to entrenched societal problems.  One of Callisto’s features is its matching system — in which a student can ask the site to store information about an assault in escrow and forward it to the school only if someone else reports another attack identifying the same assailant. The point is not just to discover possible repeat offenders. In college communities, where many survivors of sexual assault know their assailants, the idea of the information escrow is to reduce students’ fears that the first person to make an accusation could face undue repercussions.  Ms. Ladd says students may be more motivated to come forward if they can help out other survivors.  “It means that someone is a threat to my community and not just me,” she says.  At least in its initial incarnation, however, the matching function has potential drawbacks. At one school testing Callisto, for example, the site asks students to submit just one piece of identifying information to match their attackers: a link to the assailant’s Facebook page. That protocol sends students who have just experienced sexual assault to Facebook accounts where they are likely to see photos of their attacker — and the friends they might have in common.  “That almost builds in a deterrent to reporting,” says Keith Hiatt, the director of the technology program at the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. “You start to envision the consequences that could arise from reporting.”  Ms. Ladd said she and her team had consulted with sexual assault survivors during the site’s development process and they did not find the Facebook identifier problematic. She added that the team worked with college administrators to determine the matching identifier, like a school email address, that would work best for their campus.  The larger issue here is that, in acknowledging a culture in which people who consider filing sexual assault reports reasonably fear they will not be believed, the Callisto matching function may inadvertently reinforce the societal message that survivors are safer sitting on their accounts until someone else is assaulted and comes forward.  “It might allow people who have survived sexual assault to get over the first-mover disadvantage, but it may also codify an entrenched attitude that women need to have corroborating evidence to be believed,” says Mr. Hiatt of the Berkeley Law School. “We have to be a little sad that we live in a world where something like this is necessary.”',1
'AFTER OUTCRY, IRELAND ADJUSTS ITS CORPORATE TAX DRAW Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  CORK, Ireland — As lord mayor of this quiet seaside city in southern Ireland, Chris O’Leary seems to have a situation most other local politicians can only dream about.          Blue-chip international companies like Apple, Dell and IBM have all set up shop in and around this city, filling newly built office blocks near the city’s port and sprawling office parks in the suburbs. The companies set up shop here for the cheap workers, business-friendly lawmakers and — above all — Ireland’s low corporate tax rate. Since the height of the financial crisis in 2011, the region’s unemployment rate has fallen by more than four percentage points, to 9.9 percent, or roughly the national average, according to government statistics.  “What has made us different is how we’ve gone about our business,” said Mr. O’Leary, 55, in his city hall office, decorated with a black-and-white photo of President John F. Kennedy’s visit here in 1963 and a copy of the city’s centuries-old charter.  That way of business is now under attack, though — and the potential benefit of Ireland’s most recent tax strategy for attracting companies is in doubt.  In recent years, other European countries have accused the country of acting like an unfair low-tax haven. The European Commission, for example, is investigating whether Ireland gave Apple a preferential tax deal that broke the region’s tough state-aid rules. While lawmakers and the company have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, the country is already phasing out the most controversial loopholes.  Ireland has since turned to a new inducement: a low tax rate on revenue generated from patents and other intellectual property held in Ireland. Such an incentive — announced last month to be 6.25 percent, or half of the country’s corporate tax rate — could be most attractive to patent-heavy industries like technology and pharmaceuticals.  But many tax experts say the benefits will be significantly smaller than many had expected, particularly for global tech giants.  Because of recent changes to global agreements, Ireland must limit what type of intellectual property can be included in these low-tax structures, known locally as a “knowledge development box.” Such restrictions have been demanded by several European countries, particularly Germany, which raised concerns that Ireland and other countries would turn to such structures to unfairly lower corporate tax rates.  Under international law, Ireland and other countries like Britain and potentially the United States can offer the tax breaks only on intellectual property derived from research carried out in their national borders. Much of the research and development for technology companies is done outside Ireland. So revenue from global patents like those linked to Google’s search algorithm, many of which were developed in the United States, will not be eligible for the reduced tax treatment.  “It won’t be much help to many international companies,” said Anna Scally, head of the technology, media and telecom practice in Ireland at KPMG, an accounting company that has helped global companies with their Irish tax arrangements.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some local policy makers are concerned that Ireland’s ability to entice international companies may be hampered by the restrictions on the country’s latest tax proposals. But others cite Ireland’s flexible (and increasingly multicultural) work force and its close ties to the United States as the reasons global companies, particularly those from the tech industry, will continue to knock on Ireland’s door.  “We’re closer to Boston than we are to Berlin,” said Mr. O’Leary, Cork’s mayor. “Companies aren’t just coming for the corporate tax rate.”  While lawmakers often play down its importance, Ireland’s 12.5 percent tax rate (versus 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States) has been a mainstay in the country’s decades-long strategy to attract the world’s largest companies. With few natural and manufacturing resources, Ireland and its politicians instead have turned to one of the world’s lowest corporate tax rates as the country’s primary competitive advantage in the global economy.  The bet has paid off. The country collected $4.2 billion in corporation tax in the first nine months of the year, or almost 50 percent more than the period last year, according to government records.  “We see tax as just part of the overall package that we can offer companies,” Richard Bruton, Ireland’s minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation, said in an interview.  Companies do not appear to be shying away from the country. Representatives from Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook declined to comment on Ireland’s new tax mechanism. But just last week, for instance, Apple said it would increase its work force in Cork by 20 percent, to 6,000 employees, by 2017. IBM and Pfizer, the drug maker, also recently announced plans to expand their Irish operations.  Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, a lobbying group that represents many of the companies, said there were other incentives, including tax breaks of up to 25 percent on research and development conducted in Ireland, that still were available to international companies.  “The knowledge development box is not the only show in town,” Mr. Redmond said.  And experts say global pharmaceutical companies, many of which operate research and development facilities in Ireland, could benefit from the country’s 6.25 percent tax rate on revenue derived from locally held intellectual property more than their counterparts in the tech industry.  “The low rate eventually could encourage companies to carry out R.&D. here in Ireland,” said Joe Tynan, head of tax at PricewaterhouseCoopers in the accountancy firm’s Dublin office.  Still, for regulators who have tried to limit Ireland’s tax advantage, the restrictions placed on the country’s knowledge development box represents a victory in the global push to close unfair tax loopholes. Some companies in Ireland had lobbied for a wider definition of what type of intellectual property, especially linked to online advertising and search patents moved from other countries to Ireland, that could be included in the tax mechanism. Those efforts, though, failed.  Pascal Saint-Amans, tax director at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been charged with drafting new standards to avoid multinational tax avoidance, said these low-tax mechanisms had to be linked solely to intellectual property from research and development conducted within a country’s borders.  Otherwise, Mr. Saint-Amans added, international companies could unfairly move patents between countries in a bid to pay the lowest amount of tax.  “The greater amount of global intellectual property you include in these mechanisms, the more likely it is that they will be harmful,” he said. “The goal should be to attract real R.&D. to a country, not to compete just on tax rates.”',0
'GENE AMDAHL, PIONEER OF MAINFRAME COMPUTING, DIES AT 92 Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Gene Amdahl, a trailblazer in the design of IBM’s mainframe computers, which became the central nervous system for businesses large and small throughout the world, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 92.          His wife, Marian, said the cause was pneumonia. He had been treated for Alzheimer’s disease for about five years, she said.  Dr. Amdahl rose from South Dakota farm country, where he attended a one-room school without electricity, to become the epitome of a generation of computer pioneers who combined intellectual brilliance, managerial skill and entrepreneurial vigor to fuel the early growth of the industry.  As a young computer scientist at International Business Machines Corporation in the early 1960s, he played a crucial role in the development of the System/360 series, the most successful line of mainframe computers in IBM’s history. Its architecture influenced computer design for years to come.  The 360 series was not one computer but a family of compatible machines. Computers in the series used processors of different speeds and power, yet all understood a common language.  This allowed customers to purchase a smaller system knowing they could migrate to a larger, more powerful machine if their needs grew, without reprogramming the application software. IBM’s current mainframes can still run some System/360 applications.  The system was announced at IBM’s annual shareholders meeting on April 7, 1964, in Endicott, N.Y., a village near Binghamton where the company had opened a facility early in the 20th century.  At the meeting, Thomas J. Watson Jr., then chairman and chief executive, singled out Dr. Amdahl as the “father” of the new computer. “I remember it very clearly,” Marian Amdahl said in an interview. “Gene was so proud of that.”  Michael J. Flynn, a computer scientist at Stanford University and former colleague of Dr. Amdahl’s at IBM, said the 360 series “set the design philosophy for computers for the next 50 years, and to this day it’s still out there, which is incredible.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “This same instruction set,” he added, “is still bringing in billions of dollars for IBM.”  Dr. Amdahl is remembered at IBM as an intellectual leader who could get different strong-minded groups to reach agreement on technical issues.  “By sheer intellectual force, plus some argument and banging on the table, he maintained architectural consistency across six engineering teams,” said Frederick P. Brooks Jr., a computer scientist who was the project manager of the System/360 and is now at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Photo  Dr. Amdahl’s business instincts and ambitions manifested themselves in 1970, when he left IBM to build a company to rival it. At the time, the market for mainframe computers belonged almost exclusively to IBM.  With funding from Fujitsu, he formed the Amdahl Corporation, setting up offices in Sunnyvale, Calif.  “We took about three weeks to do an analysis of the formidable task of competing head-on with IBM,” Dr. Amdahl said in a 2007 interview with Solid-State Circuits Society News.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  His idea was to build machines compatible with hardware and software for the System/370, the successor to the System/360. He pointedly named it the 470 series, and in 1975 his company shipped the first of the machines. It proved faster and less expensive than IBM’s comparable computers.  By purchasing an Amdahl computer and so-called plug-compatible peripheral devices from third-party manufacturers, customers could now run System/370 programs without buying IBM hardware.  The Amdahl Corporation was not the first to make IBM-compatible computers, but it managed to compete successfully against IBM where large companies like RCA and General Electric had failed.  Amdahl also benefited from antitrust settlements between IBM and the Justice Department, which required IBM to make its mainframe software available to competitors.  By 1979, the year Dr. Amdahl left the company to start another venture, Amdahl had more than $200 million in annual revenue and 22 percent of the mainframe market.  (Fujitsu bought the remaining interest in Amdahl in 1997 and made it a wholly owned subsidiary. It has since been dissolved as a stand-alone entity.)  Dr. Amdahl also formulated what became known as Amdahl’s Law, which is used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum improvement in speed using multiple processors.  Gene Myron Amdahl was born on Nov. 16, 1922, in Flandreau, S.D., to parents of Norwegian and Swedish descent. He grew up on a farm and attended a one-room school through the eighth grade. Rural electrification did not reach his town until he was a freshman in high school.  After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he tried to join the military, but the Selective Service turned him down, deeming his farming skills more important. “They’d drafted so many of the youth that there weren’t enough people to harvest,” he told an interviewer in 1989.  Dr. Amdahl finally joined the service, the Navy, in 1944, and taught radar at naval training centers around the country. In 1946 he married Marian Quissell, who grew up on a farm four miles from his.  He received his bachelor’s degree in 1948 from South Dakota State University, in Brookings, where his wife worked as a secretary. She had dropped out of Augustana College in Sioux Falls, S.D., after her freshman year to go to work to help pay for her husband’s education. In 1952 he received his doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  It was in graduate school that his interest in the nascent field of digital computers took root. For his Ph.D. thesis, he drafted a design for what became known as the Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer, or W.I.S.C., an early digital computer.  Dr. Amdahl was recruited by IBM after a branch manager in Madison visited him at the university and offered him a job straight out of graduate school.  After the success of the System/360 project, Dr. Amdahl moved to California in 1964, weary of what he described as “the time and politicking demands” at IBM’s corporate headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. In California, he managed an IBM engineering laboratory for six years before starting Amdahl in Sunnyvale, in the heart of Silicon Valley.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dr. Amdahl also encountered both technical and business disappointments. One was Trilogy Systems, which he created after leaving Amdahl in 1979. Trilogy set out to build an integrated chip that would allow mainframe manufacturers to build computers at lower costs. It raised more than $200 million in public and private financing. Yet the chip development ultimately failed.  In 1987 Dr. Amdahl started the Andor Corporation, hoping to compete in the midsize mainframe market using improved manufacturing techniques. But the company encountered production problems, which, together with strong competition, led it to bankruptcy in 1995.  Besides his wife, Dr. Amdahl is survived by two daughters, Delaine Amdahl and Andrea Amdahl; a son, Carlton, who was vice chairman of Trilogy; a brother, Lowell; and five grandchildren.  Despite his business failures later in life, Mr. Amdahl’s reputation for technical brilliance endured. Dag Spicer, senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., compared him to two of the industry’s greatest computer architects.  “He’s always been right up there with Seymour Cray or Steve Wozniak,” Mr. Spicer said, “with real cachet in the technical community.”',0
'JOE’S CRAB SHACK TO TEST NO-TIPPING POLICY Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Following in the footsteps of the Danny Meyer restaurant group, Joe’s Crab Shack, a Houston-based chain with more than 130 locations nationwide, announced on Wednesday that it would test a no-tipping system in one of the largest trials yet of the policy.  The casual seafood chain will adopt the change at 18 locations, its parent company, Ignite Restaurants, said in a statement. The company indicated that menu prices would rise to absorb the added labor costs, but said the increase would be “typically less than the average 20 percent service tip.” It didn’t say when the new policy would begin.  “We believe that consistently great service should always be included in the menu price, so we are taking the responsibility for paying the service staff,” Ray Blanchette, chief executive, said in the statement. “I personally believe tipping is an antiquated model and you have seen most businesses in America migrate away from it over the last 50 to 100 years.”  Other restaurants have made similar decisions in recent years, notably the Union Square Hospitality Group, the company owned by Mr. Meyer that announced in October that it would eliminate tipping for 1,800 employees at its 13 restaurants by the end of 2016.  Servers are sometimes paid wages well under the minimum wage, relying on tips to make up the difference. But the system can be volatile, enabling servers to make a mint on a busy night or take home little when business slumps. For customers, tipping can represent an annoying math problem, even if they appreciate the ability to reward good service or protest shortcomings.  The policy would put Joe’s Crab Shack “above the fray” in minimum wage debates, Mr. Blanchette said in a conference call last week, according to The Orange County Register. He also predicted that it would be preferred by employees.  “It’s expected to result in an improved team atmosphere, a significant reduction in turnover and greater financial security for the employees,” he said on the call, according to CNBC.  Responding to the Union Square Hospitality Group’s decision in October, the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a group that has fought for the elimination of tipping, said it hoped others in the industry would follow suit.  “These forward-looking employers who are taking the high road to profitability through policies that ensure a living wage for employees will show the nation that dignity and profitability are not mutually-exclusive ideas at America’s restaurants,” Saru Jayaraman, the group’s co-founder, said in a statement.  Restaurants give up a significant tax credit by eliminating tips, and the potential effect on menu prices is uncertain. Drew Nieporent, the owner of 10 restaurants in New York City and London, said in October that diners might be unwilling to foot significant price increases.  “Tipping is a way of life in this country,” he said. “It may not be the perfect system, but it’s our system. It’s an American system.”',0
'ANDREW RICHARDSON, THE MAN WHO NAMED A MAGAZINE AFTER HIMSELF Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  When Andrew Richardson visited Japan last month, customs officials confiscated copies of his magazine, Richardson, for its sexually explicit photos. About a year ago, his Instagram account was temporarily suspended for showing a part of a woman’s derrière.          And at the New York Art Book Fair, held in September at MoMA P.S.1, Mr. Richardson sold a zine with images of duct-taped women held hostage by frat boys. While wandering the fair, he bought stickers from the feminist art collective Guerrilla Girls. “They would put a stake through my heart if they knew who I was,” he said.  Mr. Richardson enjoys being a provocateur.  After a career as a fashion stylist for clients like Calvin Klein and Valentino, he is arousing attention on his own. The current issue of Richardson magazine features a mostly nude cover photo of the rap vixen Blac Chyna, pornographic prison drawings and male nudes by the photographer Bob Mizer.  His streetwear label, also called Richardson, includes logo-speckled T-shirts, bombers and balaclavas. It has been spotted on Rihanna and Kate Moss but remains an in-the-know signifier for skaters, art kids and downtown types. His eclectic vision of erotica comes together at his Lower East Side boutique; a second store opens on Dec. 1 in East Hollywood in Los Angeles, next to a theater that shows X-rated movies.  “Andrew likes to live and act in the margins,” said David Sims, the British fashion photographer who recently worked with Mr. Richardson on a book for Supreme, the influential skating company. “He’s an obsessive, most often for something that is so obscure that I can’t help but suspect the fix is on the journey as much as the object of his desire.”  On a recent Monday afternoon, Mr. Richardson lounged on a sectional couch in his Forsyth Street apartment overlooking Sara D. Roosevelt Park. He was wearing his company’s red sweatpants and glasses with a rose-tinted frame. Afghan rugs depicting grenades and Kalashnikovs covered the floor. A photo of P. Diddy captioned with an Oscar Wilde quote adorned the wall.  “I’m 49 years old and I’m still living a somewhat adolescent life,” Mr. Richardson said, in a pacifying British accent. “You know, I’m sort of happy about it. As you get older, you can get really restrained by fear of your future.”  Born in Marlow, England, a town outside London, Mr. Richardson is the son of a civil engineer father and a stay-at-home mother. He described himself as an adventurous child. “It was always me and some friend who were drunk at 11 years old at a wine tasting at the rugby club,” he said. (He has been sober for a decade, he said.)  By 19, he was managing the Kenzo men’s store in London and immersed in a night-life scene that included experimental Mutoid Waste Company art parties and the embryonic stage of raves. “We walked around like dandies living in council flats,” Mr. Richardson said of his interest in fashion. “You were obsessed with saving everything and buying one pair of Comme des Garçons trousers on sale.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the late 1980s, he moved to New York to work for a company that designed men’s wear for Charivari, the au courant boutique that closed in 1999. While staying in a loft on West 26th Street, Mr. Richardson met several photography assistants. “These kids were making much more money than me, flying all over the world and surrounded by beautiful women,” he said. “So I was like, ‘That’s what I should do.’”  He found his entre through styling. While assisting the photographer Steven Meisel (whom Mr. Richardson calls his “father in the business”), he assembled tear sheets with mononymous supermodels. “We worked with Linda, Christy and Naomi,” Mr. Richardson said. When working on Madonna’s 1992 book, “Sex,” he familiarized himself with New York sex shops and began integrating rubber clothing and S&M themes into his aesthetic.  Richardson magazine, which is published annually and has a circulation of 3,500, has navigated the same murky boundaries between art and obscenity. The first issue, released in 1998 by Little More, a Japanese publisher, included a spread with Jenna Jameson, the adult film star, and Richard Prince’s “Spiritual America,” showing 11-year-old Brooke Shields in a bathtub.  With contributors like Terry Richardson (no relation), the magazine has suffered consequences for being risqué. Last year, a Nobuyoshi Araki cover photo of a nude woman with a noose around her neck prompted the website’s credit card processor, Stripe, to sever ties temporarily.  “You can’t be a full examination of the human id,” Mr. Richardson said. “You can’t be your id. You have to have the conscious filter of what’s appropriate and where the line is.”  Mr. Richardson’s clothing label started as an afterthought to a 2003 T-shirt collaboration with Supreme. It has expanded to include items like car club jackets ($629) and carpenter pants ($275), but the line’s most popular item is a $22 T-shirt that reads “Richardson Hardware” with the address of his second-floor Broome Street storefront.  Other designs riff on familiar American iconography, like a tweaked version of the Narcotics Anonymous emblem. “We’re into subverting the U.S. Marines logo, for example,” he said, “because the drill instructor from ‘Full Metal Jacket’ is like a sexual dom.”  After the book fair, Mr. Richardson and a small cohort of friends and assistants encircled a table at Sapphire Gentlemen’s Club, a Manhattan strip joint beneath the Queensboro Bridge.  As Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz’ “Get Low” thundered, he flung bills toward the stage and received a lap dance from a woman wearing nipple rings and thigh-high stockings.  A bald, thick-necked patron, who said his father was an electrician, inquired about the “Local 143” insignia on Mr. Richardson’s jacket, which, naturally, was from his own line. “It’s a Lower East Side union, bro,” was the reply.',0
'WHY I’M PROUD TO BE A ‘TOKEN MAN’ The marketing industry is rife with advice on how to be a good leader: hire people better than you; anything related to shoulders and giants; bring in fantastic people and learn from them, and so on. That’s all great, but it doesn’t drill down to what really matters or even begin to approach the more immediate, contemporary issues of equality and diversity.  This is all about to change, thanks to an initiative called Token Man.  The initiative aims to give men a better understanding of the challenges women face at work, through a series of interviews and events, flipping the traditional ratio of men to women. This is sorely needed. It might not be palatable, but it’s a fact that this industry has long been castigated as a bastion of sexism and misogyny. We may not quite be stuck in the “Mad Men” days of typing pools and blatant abuse, but no one could claim we have enough Peggy Olsons.  Famously, or should I say infamously, just 3% of creative directors are female. This week’s equal pay day was a stark reminder that women still earn an average of 15% less than their male counterparts. These are awful statistics, caused in part by the myopia of our industry, searching only in expected places when recruiting, and the pub-chatter reliance on personal networks and little black books. They’re also easy to hide from with the usual lazy excuses: “It’s not just us.” “We’d hire more women if we could find them.”  Why not do a bit more work and be a bit more interested in the world? After all, it is our industry’s job to connect; to influence and be influenced by the world around us. It’s what we get paid to do and it’s what we’re expected to be. Quite honestly, if we’re not going to drive change, be brave or look in those unexpected places, then who will?  I’m committed to fighting the battle and driving change wherever I can. I’m a proud dad to three very special kids (two of them girls) and in that typical new-dad cliche, I want them to experience a world free from worry, bias or prejudice. I want my girls, and my son, to achieve whatever they want and to become whatever they want to be. Scientist. Artist. Astronaut. Chef. Creative director. Racing driver. Butcher. Baker. Candlestick maker. If that’s what they want, I want them to know that I’ll be proud of them regardless and that I’ll be cheering them on, whatever choices they make.  I want them to be able to make those choices without the obstacles, pressures and boundaries (all of them lazy, avoidable or reversible) that, while we might not like to admit it, we see all the time, all around us. We all have the ability to remove our blinkers and do something about these issues. We just need to start acting differently and making different choices.  Obviously, I’m proud of my kids. I’m going to support them, now and always. But I also want them to be proud of me and share my pride in being a Token Man. It gives me a flag to wave and a banner to carry, and, most of all, a constant reminder to avoid the easy, lazy way forward. We can all create change if we want to.',1
'THERE IS A MUSEUM OF FEMALE EMANCIPATION: THE WOMEN’S LIBRARY I was sorry to read that Deborah Orr thinks there has never been “a museum dedicated to the evolution of female emancipation” (Forget the V&A, 7 November). The Women’s Library, whose original collections were those of the female suffrage petitioners of 1866, is an accredited national museum as well as a library and archive, and its contents cover changes in women’s lives from the 18th century to the present day. It was forced to leave its purpose-built and Heritage Lottery-funded premises in London Metropolitan University in 2013, but is now housed at the LSE, where a new exhibition space on the ground floor of the main Library building is open to all. Exhibitions in 2016 will celebrate women’s work for peace and equality, as well as the 150th anniversary of the 1866 petition to parliament which led to the founding of today’s Fawcett Society.

'INTO THE BADLANDS: SLAVERY SCI-FI WITH A KUNG FU EDGE THAT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE What’s the name of the show? Into the Badlands.  Is this a remake of the Sissy Spacek movie? Ha. No, that was just Badlands. And there is nothing out there like Into the Badlands.  When does it premiere? Sunday, 15 November, at 10pm EST, right after The Walking Dead, which means AMC is really invested in its success.  It’s on AMC, so it has to be a prestige drama with lots of antiheroes going through existential angst in the suburbs, right? Oh, golly, how wrong you are.  So, what is this thing, then? You know, just your standard martial arts show about warring barons and their minions in a post-apocalyptic America. Well, actually, we don’t know if there was an apocalypse or if it’s in America. It sort of looks like 1886 but it also sort of looks like the future, so who knows. It could be a galaxy long, long ago and far, far away.  That’s not really helping. What exactly happens? So, seven different barons, who are sort of like plantation owners, rule this country. They each make all their money off of one crop. The baron we know the most about is Quinn (Martin Csokas), who grows opium poppies, for instance. He has both a bunch of “cogs”, who are the slaves who work the fields, and highly trained “clippers”, who are his enforcers. There are also marauding packs of “nomads”.  This is making a bit more sense. Quinn’s main clipper is a guy called Sunny (Daniel Wu), whom he found orphaned as a child and treats as a member of the family. In the series opening, Sunny finds MK (Aramis Knight), a cog who has been kidnapped by a bunch of nomads. It turns out he has some mysterious dark powers that make him special.  Each sequence is incredibly choreographed, like a tap-dance number with 40 dancers  OK, you lost me again. And didn’t you say something about martial arts? Yes. Sunny, the clippers and the barons all are masters of martial arts, the over-the-top kind you see in Hong Kong action movies where it seems like they can fly.  Is the fighting good? It is the absolute best fighting you’ve seen on TV. It’s sort of in the Kill Bill style, where each fight is a dramatic tableau set in a picturesque location – a rainy street, a factory, a forest glen – that quickly fills with bloody corpses and snapped limbs. Each sequence is incredibly choreographed, like a tap-dance number with 40 dancers all doing the same thing at once.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ally Ioannides as Tilda in Into the Badlands. Photograph: Patti Perret/AMC/AMC  This show sounds insane. It is absolutely bonkers and there is nothing else like it on television, which is what makes it so appealing to me. Yes, Sunny is your classic TV antihero who has to choose between serving his baron and escaping with his pregnant girlfriend, Veil (Madeleine Mantock). There is a bit of a Game of Thrones vibe too, with this universe that is like ours but very different. Also, each baron has his own color scheme, banner and allegiances, as with the different houses on Game of Thrones. But even so, there is no real comparison to this show.  It may be different, but is it good? I think so, yes, with some caveats. I’m a big fan of comic books, and watching Into the Badlands is kind of like starting a new comic book series. You’re welcomed into this fully immersive universe with its own rules, words, fashion and way of doing things. The viewer just has to accept a lot of different things and go along for the ride. If any of the elements seem too outlandish for certain viewers, the show is probably going to lose them, but those willing to submit to the world-building will be thoroughly rewarded. Also, the show doesn’t really elevate the comic-esque material as The Walking Dead does. This show is happy to just be a genre piece, a bit of grindhouse fare on an arthouse channel.  The way the show is shot is a little odd. There are ornate sets and costumes, but they’re all rendered in a sort of saturated color scheme that reminds me mostly of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, the one with Kevin Sorbo. So, yeah, it looks a little cheap, even though it clearly isn’t. Combine the sci-fi elements and the artistic decisions and you end up with something that looks, well, cheesy.  That said, cheesy isn’t necessarily bad. Empire can be mighty cheesy. So can The Walking Dead. So can just about every superhero movie. There is nothing on Earth outside of the Kraft factory that is cheesier than Full House, and that is getting a revival on Netflix. There is something about cheesy done right that is simultaneously comforting and exhilarating, and I think Into the Badlands finds that sweet spot.  Come on, a show this crazy can’t be all good. Yes, there are some problems with it. Some of the acting isn’t great and some of the dialogue could use some fine-tuning, but most of what you’re seeing is engaging and interesting. And, for the first time in a long time, I have absolutely no idea where this show is going. So, like wearing a caftan as a wedding dress, it may not win points for quality, but it definitely scores for ingenuity and nerve.  So you think I should watch this show? I gave it the season pass on the DVR, just because I’m curious how this thing is going to play out, and the fight scenes are worth the price of admission. That said, this isn’t for everyone. If you like comic books, Doctor Who, Kill Bill, or things that really make you scratch your head, give this a whirl. More conservative viewers should probably sit this fight out.  Into the Badlands starts Sunday 15 November at 10pm EST on AMC in the US, and Tuesday 17 November on Amazon Prime in the UK',0
'‘KINGDOM OF DAUGHTERS’ IN CHINA DRAWS TOURISTS TO ITS MATRILINEAL SOCIETY Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  LUGU LAKE, China — A young man clad in a white shirt, black pants and red belt suddenly scrambled up the side of a log house and slid feet first into a second-story latticed window.          “This is how Mosuo men would climb into the ‘flower room’ of the women,” Ke Mu explained to visitors as the triumphant swain stuck his head out the window of the flower room, or private bedroom, and waved his hat.  It was morning in the lakeside village of Luoshui here in southwestern China. On a narrow side street, dusty from hotel construction nearby, a group of young workers, including Ms. Ke, 18, was preparing for another day of cultural pageantry at the Mosuo Folk Museum.  Their task is to showcase the traditions of the Mosuo, a minority ethnic group said to be the country’s last matrilineal society, where children take their mothers’ surnames and daughters are preferred to sons.  A fascination with such traditions has led to a booming tourism industry in this once-isolated region.  Lured by the promise of spectacular natural beauty and exotic cultural experiences, hundreds of thousands of visitors, mostly Chinese, are making the journey to Lugu Lake, nestled on a plateau in the mountains between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.  Photo  Those numbers are expected to rise with the opening of a local airport this month and later an expressway connecting Lugu Lake to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan.  In response, a number of family-run hotels have popped up along the lake’s pristine blue waters. Visitors can watch residents perform traditional dances in colorful costumes and can take boat rides on the lake as young Mosuo men serenade them with love songs in Naru, the Mosuo language.  All around the village are signs that read, “Welcome to the Kingdom of Daughters.”  Continue reading the main story Yellow R. 250 mileS SICHUAN Chengdu Lugu Lake CHINA Lijiang Dapo YUNNAN VIETNAM MYANMAR LAOS South China Sea THAILAND  Lively as its traditions seem, however, the Mosuo community is facing a crisis. As its interaction with the wider society increases, residents and outside experts fear that the group’s unique cultural practices are facing a grave threat.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Experts say that the population of Mosuo in the Lugu Lake region, estimated to be about 40,000, is decreasing as more young people marry outside the group or move to larger cities for work. And without a written language, Mosuo culture is particularly vulnerable to disappearing.  Even within the community, young Mosuo are increasingly choosing marriage over the foundation of Mosuo culture: the centuries-old practice of tiesese (pronounced tee-say-say). Known in Mandarin as zouhun, or walking marriage, tiesese is an alternative to matrimony in which men visit women at night to fulfill the need for procreation and sexual gratification. Traditionally, a Mosuo woman might have several tiesese relationships during her life, sometimes simultaneously. Though this has changed as outside values of monogamy and lifetime partnership seep in.  Photo  “It would be great to get married one day,” said Lu Ru, 34, who is in a tiesese relationship. “Can you imagine loving someone that much?”  With tiesese, sex is kept separate from family, and men and women are generally expected to spend their lives in the houses in which they were born. As a result, sexual partners rarely occupy the same dwelling. Household harmony is valued above all else, including conjugal relationships.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In traditional Mosuo culture, family life is structured around the basic social unit, known as the “grand household,” in which children are raised by their mother and her side of the family. And while children typically know their biological fathers, maternal uncles are responsible for taking on the paternal role, helping to raise and provide for their sisters’ children.  Continue reading the main story Today’s Headlines: Asia Edition Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.  Men stay with their mothers, and the several generations live in the grand household together.  According to Chuan-Kang Shih, an expert on the Mosuo and an anthropology professor at the University of Florida, the system is underpinned by a fundamental belief that women are more capable than men, mentally and even physically. The Mosuo also believe that everything people value in the world came from a woman, not a man. All male deities are secondary to their patron goddess.  “The system makes so much sense when you think about the overall ways in which family systems have to navigate between sexual desire, stability, domesticity and claims for children,” said Judith Stacey, a professor of sociology at New York University who has written about the Mosuo.  Photo  “But it depends on a lack of mobility, which is why now, with all of this inequality as well as economic and geographic mobility, it can’t survive as a system,” Professor Stacey said.  According to historical accounts, life in the Mosuo community was relatively stable for hundreds of years. Starting in the Yuan dynasty, which ruled China from 1271 to 1368, the Mosuo were governed by a native chieftain system with a rigid social hierarchy. While they lived alongside several other ethnic groups who practiced marriage, almost all Mosuo continued to practice tiesese.  That changed in 1956, when the chieftain system came to an end and the Mosuo were incorporated into the recently established Communist system. Under Communist rule, the social ranks were abolished and the Mosuo were subject to continuing efforts to change what the Communists saw as their “backward marriage customs.”  Photo  These efforts culminated in 1975 with an official “one husband, one wife” campaign, which required Mosuo sexual partners to marry and live under the same roof.  Since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, the government largely receded from everyday life among the Mosuo. But experts say the increased scrutiny left many members of the group with a conflicted attitude toward tiesese.  “In the late 1980s, the Mosuo were either very defensive or denied the existence altogether of the so-called walking marriage,” Professor Shih said. “Then in the mid-1990s, when tourism began in the Lugu Lake area, they began to see it as capital to attract tourists, and they started to boast about it.”  Photo  Not everyone is mourning the waning of tiesese. One recent afternoon, Lu Zuo, 78, a retired farmer, sipped yak butter tea on the floor beside the hearth in his longtime tiesese partner’s home in the Mosuo village of Dapo, about a 45-minute drive from Lugu Lake. A small white bust of Mao Zedong sits above the hearth flanked by two red vertical banners inscribed with Buddhist prayers in Tibetan script.  Mr. Lu watched as his daughter and two sons set the table for lunch. Before eating, the daughter, Song Na, 49, took a small piece of potato from the table and placed it on a black stone at the back of the hearth to honor the family’s ancestors.  After lunch, she left her brothers and nieces to clear the table and walked across the street to an empty yard where she would not be overheard.  She talked about her longtime tiesese partner and their two daughters, both of whom were working in Lijiang, about seven hours away by car.  “They probably won’t enter a walking marriage,” Ms. Song said. But what mattered most to her was not the tiesese tradition but its underlying values.  “As long as they come back to take care of the household,” she said.',1
'AFTER A MASS EXTINCTION, ONLY THE SMALL SURVIVE Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  From sharks to giraffes, many of Earth’s biggest and most magnificent species are threatened with extinction. A new study of the fossil record indicates that once large vertebrates disappear, evolution cannot quickly restore them — for tens of millions of years, most animals remain small.          The study, published Thursday in Science, emerged from research carried out by Lauren Sallan, a paleontologist at the University of Pennsylvania.  Studying fish that lived during the Mississippian Period, from 359 million to 323 million years ago, she noticed that they were substantially smaller than their ancestors.  “It piqued my curiosity,” Dr. Sallan said in an interview. “Why are these fish so small?” (She earned a nickname from her fellow paleontologists: the Sardine Queen.)  Other paleontologists had previously noticed that some groups of species seemed to shrink in size over time. It’s called the Lilliput Effect, after the fictional island in Jonathan Swift’s “Gulliver’s Travels” inhabited by tiny people.  Researchers found that the Lilliput Effect often occurred after abrupt and widespread extinctions. Dr. Sallan’s fish appeared to fit the pattern: They shrank after a mass extinction at the end of the Devonian Period, 359 million years ago.  Scientists suspect that this mass extinction was triggered by a global chill that brought glaciers all the way to the tropics. The deep freeze was brutal both for fishes and for the early land vertebrates (known as tetrapods) that were just starting to clamber around on feet with toes. An estimated 96 percent of all vertebrates became extinct at the beginning of the Mississippian Period.  Still, scientists have been uncertain about how important the Lilliput Effect was. The cases documented by paleontologists had been limited to small groups of species and typically the researchers only looked at fossils over a limited stretch of time, before and after mass extinctions.  Some thought these Great Shrinkings might be illusory; small-bodied fossils, they noted, might be more likely to be preserved than big ones. Dr. Sallan decided to put the Lilliput Effect to a stronger test.  Working with Andrew K. Gallimberti, then an undergraduate at Kalamazoo College, Dr. Sallan studied every known vertebrate species that lived in both the Devonian and Mississippian. With online databases and digitized fossil scans, Dr. Sallan and Mr. Gallimberti estimated the body lengths of 1,120 fossilized animals.  After the mass extinction 359 million years ago, the scientists found, vertebrates were smaller on average than before, and they stayed that way for the next 36 million years.  Photo  Peter J. Wagner, a curator of paleobiology at the Smithsonian Institution who was not involved in the study, said one of its strengths was the broad stretch of time it covered.  Previous studies were “more like snapshots of what things were like before and afterwards,” he said. “This study goes much further.” Dr. Wagner, who wrote a commentary in Science accompanying the new study, said the work was also important because it dissected the Lilliput Effect, examining trends in different groups of species.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some groups simply stayed at the same diminished size during the Mississippian, while others steadily shrank. Sharks, for example, dwindled from over a yard long to about just a few inches. Our own tetrapod relatives shrank from the size of dogs to the size of cats or smaller.  That’s not to say that all vertebrates got tiny — a few actually got bigger. One group of monstrous fish called rhizodontids, for example, included some species that grew to nearly the size of a killer whale.  But these groups of big vertebrates didn’t produce many new species. Instead, they dwindled in diversity until they became extinct altogether. That’s why we watch “Shark Week” instead of “Rhizodontid Week.”  Dr. Sallan said that these patterns could help explain the Lilliput Effect. Small vertebrates may have had an evolutionary edge that made them less likely to become extinct at the end of the Devonian. Perhaps they grew quickly and reproduced early in life, making them less vulnerable to ecological disruptions.  But even after the deep freeze was over, large species didn’t bounce back for a long time. Dr. Sallan suspects that this was because the world’s ecosystems remained decimated for millions of years, posing an enduring challenge to the survival of vertebrates. “They had to do more with less,” said Dr. Sallan.  Small vertebrates recolonized the planet, adapting to the ecological niches left empty by the mass extinctions. Filling those niches took an unimaginably long period of time, Dr. Sallan suggested. Only after easier niches were full did some vertebrates start evolving new patterns of growth to adapt to different niches, reaching bigger sizes in the process.  Dr. Sallan sees a worrying parallel between the extinction of large vertebrates 359 million years ago and their slow disappearances today.  If they become extinct in large numbers, she said, there’s no guarantee that evolution will bring back big species in short order.  “It’s likely that the global ecosystem will snap into this alternate state,” said Dr. Sallan — one dominated by small vertebrates. “They’ll be happy to stay there for millions of years.”',0
'FEMALE MPS CALL FOR BREASTFEEDING TO BE ALLOWED IN HOUSE OF COMMONS   Female MPs have demanded new mothers be allowed to breastfeed in the House of Commons chamber, a move they say may be seen as “ridiculously controversial” but it is necessary to get more women into parliament.  Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, called for a number of changes in a Westminster Hall debate on how to encourage women to enter politics, including proper parental leave and permits for parliamentarians to bring their pre-school children through the voting lobbies.  Related: Breastfeeding should be allowed in the workplace – even in Westminster  “This place is not representative at the moment. This is simply a fact. All of the people today speaking who have caring responsibilities – be that children, elderly relatives or partners –have made that perfectly clear. When I leave this place I want to see 50-50 representation,” Phillips said.  Phillips said it might be “ridiculously controversial” but it was time to allow breastfeeding in the chamber, raise the age limit on bringing children through the voting lobbies, and reconsider the working hours that mean many MPs are away from their families for long stretches of time. She argued the proposed changes were necessary to get more women into parliament, as well as improving life for all MPs who are parents.  Melanie Onn, MP for Great Grimsby, said it was time for parliament to modernise, as studies suggest that almost half of female MPs have no children compared with less than a third of male MPs.  “When councils make accommodation for new mums to bring their babies into their chamber and the European parliament allows babies to be breastfed by elected members during debates, isn’t it time that this place opened itself up to the 21st century, rather than hiding behind Victorian values?” she said.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian  She also suggested that parliamentary recesses coincide with school holidays so MPs could see more of their children.  Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, said unpredictability of hours was a major part of the problem, while Jo Cox, Labour MP for Batley and Spen, argued that the House of Commons was lagging far behind industry and the voluntary sector in family friendly politics. To opponents of MPs being allowed to breastfeed, she said they should be told: “This is what women do, get over it – it’s good for children.”  Related: I breastfed while working. All news mums should have the option  The debate was dominated by new female Labour and SNP members, but Simon Burns, Tory MP for Chelmsford and a former minister, cautioned that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons could invite “ridicule” from the tabloid press.  He said he backed Betty Boothroyd, former Speaker of the Commons, who said it would be allowed when workers at Tesco were allowed to do so.  There was a dilemma, Burns said, when the Commons was trying to set an example that “many many people in their workplace won’t be getting and it will just be seen as members of parliament getting privileges that they do not get”.  Therese Coffey, deputy Commons leader, backed this position, saying she did not believe there was a big enough shift in opinion among MPs to support breastfeeding in the chamber.  Many of the issues will be looked at by Sarah Childs, a professor of gender and politics at the University of Bristol, who is carrying out an independent assessment of inequalities facing men and women in parliament for the Speaker, John Bercow.',1
'LEADING HRT EXPERTS NOT CONSULTED OVER NHS MENOPAUSE GUIDANCE The UK’s leading experts on the cancer risks of hormone replacement therapy were not invited to give evidence to the committee preparing guidance for the NHS on treating the menopause, the Guardian has learned.  Prof Klim McPherson from Oxford University, who has written many papers on HRT and sat on the government’s committee on the safety of medicines when it warned doctors to prescribe as little HRT for as short a time as possible for women suffering symptoms, was not aware the guidance was being formulated until recently.  Prof Valerie Beral, also at Oxford, who leads the Million Women Study (MWS), which identified an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer with the use of the drugs, was also not asked for her views.  McPherson said he had not been consulted at all and that it was “outrageous” Beral had not been contacted by the committee.  Related: HRT media campaign underplays cancer risks, critics say  “I just find it absolutely unbelievable that they can produce guidelines on HRT without speaking to me or Val. It is absolutely ludicrous, considering the people they have spoken to,” he said.  The menopause guidance will be published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) on Thursday. The scope is broader than HRT, but recommendations concerning the drugs are expected to be central to it. A drug company-funded PR campaign has already begun to encourage wider use of the drugs, as the Guardian reported on Saturday.  In the 1960s, HRT was promoted as an elixir of youth. It was highly effective in ending the symptoms of the menopause, which affect 80% of women, but 20% of them severely. These include hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia, mood swings and tiredness. The pills also reduced fractures by improving bone density, and were expected to reduce deaths from heart disease and strokes.  But the large Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study in the US, designed to prove HRT protected women from heart attacks, had to be stopped early when it became clear it did not and that it doubled deaths from breast cancer. The results, published in 2002, and those of the Million Women Study in 2003, which confirmed the breast cancer risk, had a major impact on public confidence. The numbers of women taking HRT dropped dramatically and so did the numbers of women diagnosed with breast cancer.  McPherson said: “The breast cancer incidence went down noticeably. In whole populations.”  The committee on the safety of medicines said doctors could continue to prescribe HRT, which was an effective treatment for the symptoms of the menopause, but they should offer women the lowest dose that worked for them for as short a period of time as possible.  Since then, many articles have been written, often in small medical journals with low circulations, taking issue with the evidence against HRT and the way the WHI and MWS trials were carried out, McPherson said.  The articles claim the findings are not robust because the WHI study looked at HRT in women older than the under-60 age group that might be prescribed it, and the products and doses were different. They also claim the MWS is flawed because it is observational, following women to see which of those on HRT develop breast cancer, rather than comparing one group of women on the drugs with a comparable group of women who are not. Beral and colleagues say the size of the study overcomes that problem, because a substantial proportion of the population aged about 50 was recruited.  McPherson said the effect of the critical articles is “a winding down of the evidence base until you can point to the fact that this apparent association between HRT and breast cancer is neither here nor there and not terribly important. Meanwhile, people are getting breast cancer. It’s appalling.”  Nice declined to respond to the criticism ahead of publication of the guidance on Thursday.',1
'G20: BARACK OBAMA AND VLADIMIR PUTIN AGREE TO SYRIAN-LED TRANSITION The United States and Russia have reached consensus at the G20 on the need for “a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition” following a sidelines meeting between Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin on Sunday.    Related: G20 to discuss threat of Isis infiltrators among EU migrants after Paris attacks  A White House official said Obama and Putin had agreed the United Nations would mediate negotiations between the Syrian opposition and the regime after a ceasefire.  The thaw between Obama and Putin came in the lead-up to the summit’s working dinner, where G20 leaders were due to focus on strategies to counter violent extremism.  Earlier in the day, the US president used his opening remarks at the summit to declare America would intensify efforts to “eliminate” Islamic State and also bring about a “peaceful transition” in Syria.  The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had a brief discussion with president Obama before the leaders gathered for the G20 “family photo”.  Turnbull and Obama will meet for longer talks at the Apec summit in Manila on Tuesday.  In addition to pushing a political solution for Syria, officials told the Guardian, Obama used interventions during summit sessions on Sunday to urge leaders to produce a strong communiqué on climate change as a precursor to the UN-led climate talks in Paris next month.  Turnbull also made a couple of interventions during Sunday’s sessions, noting the Antalya summit would not meet the economic growth targets set last year in Brisbane to raise collective gross domestic product by more than 2%.  Turnbull, at his first international summit since taking over as prime minister from Tony Abbott, introduced himself to his G20 counterparts by delivering a well-worn stump speech about the importance of agility and innovation, and referring to his domestic policy agenda to boost urban infrastructure.  Turnbull quoted the mayor of Bogota: “A developed coun­try is not a place where the poor have cars. It’s where the rich use pub­lic trans­port.”  G20 honours victims of terrorism  The opening G20 session on Sunday paused for a minute’s silence to honour the 129 victims of Friday’s terror attacks in Paris, and the 102 people who died in Ankara in October when two bombs were detonated outside the railway station.  The G20 host, Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said terrorism was a threat to the world’s peace and security. There was a link between the global economy, the core focus of the G20 grouping, and security, he said.  With the summit overshadowed by the shocking events in Paris, Turnbull used a bilateral meeting with the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, to reiterate Australia’s support. “We are utterly shoulder to shoulder with you in the fight against terrorism,” Turnbull said.  Related: David Cameron arrives in Turkey for very different G20 summit  Fabius, who is standing in at the G20 for president François Hollande, told Turnbull the Paris attack had been a shock to his country.  He said extremists were provoking “civil war” by trying to divide his country against Muslims who are “not at all terrorists”.  Fabius said the attacks were deliberate strikes against French values and the French way of life – not a protest against military actions in Syria and Iraq. “What they do not accept is, it is not our actions – it is what we are.”  Fabius said the terrorists deliberately targeted a nightclub district because they “don’t accept the fact that we dance”.  “They want the majority of the population to equate Muslims to terrorism in order to have some sort of civil war,” he said.  European leaders at the summit rejected calls by right wing populist parties and governments in the EU to drastically overhaul migration rules in the wake of the Paris attacks.  The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said refugees fleeing Syria were trying to escape extremism, not perpetrate it.  “Those who organised, who perpetrated, the attacks are the very same people who the refugees are fleeing, and not the opposite,” Juncker said in a press conference. “And so there is no need for an overall review of the European policy on refugees.”  Turnbull focused on trade talks  The prime minister pushed on with a program of bilateral meetings at the Antalya summit on Sunday.  Related: Australia to launch free trade talks with EU in 2017  Early in the day he secured agreement from the leadership of the European Union to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement between Australia and the EU in 2017.  Turnbull had previously secured the backing of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, during their meeting in Berlin on Friday to pursue the free trade agreement with the EU.  Later on Sunday, Turnbull met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to press for the conclusion of a bilateral trade deal with New Delhi. Turnbull told Modi Australia was “very keen” to progress trade talks.  Modi said Australia and India were “very close friends and forging ahead as strategic partners.”  Turnbull was due to meet the president of China, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit on Monday morning before leaving Turkey for the Apec summit.',0
'MINNEAPOLIS PROTESTS ERUPT AFTER POLICE SHOOT BLACK MAN ALLEGEDLY IN HANDCUFFS A Minnesota agency is investigating the shooting by a Minneapolis police officer of a black man suspected in an assault, an incident that sparked protests and prompted a community forum with the mayor and police chief.  Accounts from some witnesses that the man was handcuffed when he was shot early on Sunday morning led to outrage. Police said their preliminary investigation shows the man was not handcuffed, but the investigation is ongoing.  Jason Sole, chair of the Minneapolis NAACP’s criminal justice committee, said many black residents of north Minneapolis are upset.  “We have been saying for a significant amount of time that Minneapolis is one bullet away from Ferguson,” he said, referring to the police shooting of Michael Brown last year in the St Louis suburb that prompted nationwide protests. “That bullet was fired last night. We want justice immediately,” Sole told Minnesota Public Radio News.  The shooting happened after police said they were called to north Minneapolis around 12.45am on Sunday for a report of an assault. When they arrived, the man had returned and was interfering with paramedics who were assisting the victim, police said. Officers tried to calm him, but there was a struggle.  At some point, an officer fired at least once, hitting the man, police said. Witnesses told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that there was a big crowd at the scene, and bystanders became agitated as police pushed them back. Some witnesses said police used a chemical irritant on the crowd.  Authorities have declined to release the man’s name, but the Minneapolis NAACP cited family members and witnesses in identifying him as Jamar Clark.  Martez McKnight, 22, told the Associated Press that Clark, his uncle, was put on life support after he was taken to a hospital.  “The family is heartbroken and traumatized by the whole event,” McKnight said.  A statement on Sunday night from state representative Raymond Dehn, who represents the area, said Clark was on life support.  Police and a spokeswoman for the Hennepin County medical center said they could not comment on the man’s condition.  Protesters organized by the group Black Lives Matter Minneapolis marched through the streets on Sunday afternoon. Some beat drums and others carried banners. The group went to a police precinct, where they banged on the door and demanded to be allowed inside.  Raeisha Williams with the Minneapolis NAACP told the AP protesters plan to stay at the precinct until the names of the officers involved are released.  Minneapolis mayor Betsy Hodges and police chief Janee Harteau held a listening session with the community on Sunday evening.  Steven Belton, interim president and CEO of the Minneapolis Urban League, was in attendance.  “There is so much anger and pain, and it’s combined with a lack of information,” Belton said.  Harteau said after the meeting that “misinformation” is being spread about the case, but she would not elaborate.  The chief said she has asked the state bureau of criminal apprehension to conduct an independent investigation.  “We need to know exactly what happened, we need to know the truth,” she said. “Everyone involved needs that and deserves that.”  Two officers are on paid leave, standard practice after such an incident.  Drew Evans, BCA superintendent, said the agency wants to talk to anyone who saw the shooting or might have video of it. When asked about the handcuffs, Evans said there were handcuffs at the scene, but added that authorities are working to determine the exact situation when the man was shot.',0
'BANGKOK HALF-MARATHON BECOMES WORLD'S LONGEST AFTER WRONG U-TURN An error by race organisers has turned Bangkok into the home of the world’s longest half-marathon.  Instead of a 13-mile run through Thailand’s capital, the Standard Chartered Bangkok marathon on Sunday accidentally extended its annual half-marathon to almost 17 miles.  The bonus miles came as a surprise to runners, who unleashed a tirade of complaints on social media after the event.  The Jogging Association of Thailand, one of two organisers of the race, admitted to the error on Monday.  “The association apologises for the mistake,” Songrakm Kraison, its vice-president, told the Associated Press. “It will not happen again in the future.”  The Athletic Association of Thailand, which oversees athletic events in the country, said it discussed the mistake with the organisers, who “admitted that a technical error happened during the half-marathon event”, said Surapong Ariyamongkol, AAT secretary general.  He said race officials responsible for pointing runners in the right direction inadvertently directed them to make a U-turn at the wrong place.  “It added more than 3km [1.8 miles] to each lap, therefore more than 6km were added to the whole half-marathon,” Surapong said. “We have rebuked the association but we could not do anything else.”  The marathon’s Facebook page filled with comments on Sunday and Monday from runners who described the error as “ridiculous”, a “massive miscalculation” and “incredibly dangerous” for runners who had trained to run just 13 miles.  Others joked that it should be renamed the “super half-marathon”, or as one Facebook comment noted, it could be seen as a byproduct of race inflation: “Hey, they increased the price this year, so you get more kilometres for your money.”',0
'SEXISM IN THE KITCHEN Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Toronto — IN June Kate Burnham, an up-and-coming pastry chef at Weslodge, a popular Toronto restaurant, filed a claim with the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, alleging that three male chefs had repeatedly harassed her verbally and physically. In several especially lurid instances, she described a colleague reaching through her legs, grabbing her crotch and holding it while humping her from behind, all in front of co-workers.          What’s surprising is not Ms. Burnham’s allegation — sexual harassment in professional kitchens is ubiquitous. What’s surprising is that someone finally came forward about it.  Indeed, in the months since, Ms. Burnham’s allegations have generated a pointed but necessary discussion in leading kitchens in Canada, the United States and around the world about the ways that sexism keeps women out — and what has to be done to change that.  High-end kitchens have long been regarded as a male domain, with culinary students worshiping brutal but allegedly brilliant men, best exemplified by the “bad boy” chef Marco Pierre White and made popular by the ludicrous character portrayed by Gordon Ramsay.  Mr. Ramsay is, at least on TV, an equal opportunity abuser. But he represents what society has decided is the ideal head chef: aggressive, abusive and above all male.  What we don’t often see is the sort of behavior that such an environment fosters among the sort of people attracted to it. Under extreme stress, young male chefs all too often take out their frustrations on the few women who dare to enter their realm.  I’ve never worked as a chef, but I’ve owned and run restaurants for almost 20 years, and the things I’ve seen — sometimes in my restaurant, under certain chefs — never cease to shock me. It often goes way beyond the everyday sexism we all must weather as women, and into what is, unmistakably, harassment and assault.  Slapping with tongs, snapping bras, relentless grabbing — women chefs learn quickly to crouch, never bend over, when picking up a pot. One woman I know, who worked as a cook at a well-known restaurant group with an outpost in Toronto, told me horror stories of a chef who’d do things like put her staff meal in a metal bowl on the floor of the kitchen because “that’s where the dogs eat.”  Many women I know in the industry heard Ms. Burnham’s story and almost yawned — not because they didn’t sympathize, but because they had heard it all before. (Sadly, I have heard some women be just as unsympathetic as their male counterparts regarding another woman’s inability to “cut it.”)  So why don’t more women in the industry come forward, as Ms. Burnham did? Many do: According to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the restaurant industry is the largest source of sexual harassment complaints. Yet all but a handful of them come from the “front of the house.” That’s because, in many restaurants (though certainly not all), working in the front of the house — tending bar, waiting tables — is often transitory work, the sort of thing you’re doing while getting a degree or trying to make it as an artist.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The kitchen is different. Particularly in high-end restaurants, people there are building careers. They start off working prep, or somewhere on the line, with hopes of one day making it to sous chef, or starting their own restaurant. The best kitchen staffs work as a tight team, and foster competition as a way of improving themselves, and for forging through 14-hour days.  That camaraderie needs to exist for the demands of the job, and it can, without sliding into a chaotic environment of accepted abuse and harassment, supported by an understood code of silence. Many women just don’t see the benefit of pointing fingers.  Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.  That’s especially the case in a town like Toronto, which is big, but not big enough that you can shake a reputation for not being a “team player.” Even in a huge metropolis like New York, the high-end restaurant community is small, and word travels fast. And so women stay quiet and adjust themselves to fit into a testosterone-fueled environment, or they leave the business.  Although there are many talented women coming out of culinary schools, it’s no surprise that there are relatively few at the top of the industry. Apologists will tell you they can’t cut it. The reality is, women ought to be uninterested in a workplace that’s not just unwelcoming, but so obviously degrades them.  It took great courage for Ms. Burnham to go public, but it has taken even more for her to weather the onslaught of sexist attacks against her on social media. (She has since left the restaurant business.) The challenge now is for other women in the industry to stand up as well.  When I’ve learned of sexism in my kitchens, I’ve taken action, and I’d like to think I’ve set the right tone for my staff. But the problem goes beyond bad apples. It’s the culture. We need public awareness, more people speaking out and a standard of zero tolerance from industry leaders. Slowly we’ll create a new restaurant industry, one that will make the era of kitchen machismo look like the sad anachronism it deserves to be.',1
'MARINE CORPS STUDY FINDS NO DETRIMENT TO MORALE IN MIXED-GENDER COMBAT UNITS Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Marine Corps has long held concerns that integrating women into combat units could erode morale in all-male platoons and lead to increased sexual tension that would undermine fighting capability. But a Marine Corps study made public by a women’s advocacy group this week found that after months of testing mixed-gender combat units, troops reported morale equal to that of all-male groups and higher than noncombat integrated groups.          In addition, the study found sexual assault levels no higher than in the Marines as a whole.  Men and women in a test group of about 400 Marines “feel a strong sense of belonging to the military, even more so when compared to other Marines of the operating forces,” the study found.  The 1,000-page study, known as the Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force, was prompted by a mandate from the Obama administration to integrate women into all combat jobs by 2016 or justify exemptions.  In September, the Marine Corps released a four-page summary of the study that said female Marines were slower, less accurate with weapons and had more injuries than men.  About 300 additional pages were released this week without the permission of the Marine Corps by Women in International Security — a group that is an advocate for women in combat roles and was leaked the documents. The additional pages suggested that although women were not as physically strong, on average, as men, the Marine Corps could successfully integrate women by setting clear standards.  “There has been this band of brothers idea that there is something special about having only men, and adding women will ruin it, ” said Ellen Haring, a senior fellow at the advocacy group and a reserve Army colonel. “The study doesn’t bear that out.”  When told by the Department of Defense in 2013 to integrate combat forces by 2016, other military branches responded by analyzing combat specialties to create gender-neutral standards based on the physical demands of the job. If a woman could meet the standards, she could serve in the position. The Army, Air Force and Navy have not indicated that they will ask for exemptions.  But the Marine Corps, with a 93 percent male force dominated by infantry members who carry heavy loads and live in spartan conditions, had a harder task.  A military official with knowledge of the decision who was not authorized to speak for the Marines said the former commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who now heads the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended exempting women from the infantry. The Marine Corps declined to comment.  The Corps approached the question of integration differently from other branches. It commissioned the nine-month ground combat study that put 300 men and 100 women in teams that performed combat skills ranging from shooting to hiking and climbing walls.  “Instead of seeing if women could meet standards, they essentially set up a race to see who was better,” Ms. Haring said.  The study found all-male units overwhelmingly outperformed integrated units in physical tasks — particularly tasks requiring upper body strength, such as evacuating an injured Marine from a turret or throwing a backpack onto a wall. But, the report said, integrated groups excelled at complex decision-making. It also concluded that adding women to all-male groups would probably improve the behavior of the groups as a whole.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Integration of females is likely to lower the instance of disciplinary action, and this has been shown in general across the Marine Corps,” the report said.  During the months women and men were in proximity, the task force recorded seven sexual assaults. Only one was formally reported. The numbers, the report said, were not significantly different from those of other units.  “There are no indications that rates of sexual harassment and sexual assault will rise following gender integration,” the report concluded.  Brig. Gen. George W. Smith Jr., director of the Marine Corps Force Innovation Office, sounded a note of caution in the memorandum he submitted with the study findings, saying diluting strength in pursuit of inclusion was “a prescription for failure.”  “Our future enemies will be the ultimate arbiter of such decisions — when lives of our Marines are in the balance. Those who choose to turn a blind eye to those immutable realities do so at the expense of our Corps’ war-fighting capability.”',1
'MEN DOMINATE IN POLITICAL GIVING; HILLARY CLINTON’S DONORS ARE AN EXCEPTION Advertisement Continue reading the main story  More women vote than men, and it has been true for decades. But women lag way behind men in another measure of political participation. Only about 30 percent of big donors to campaigns are women, which, in an election that’s forecast to feed on billions of dollars of donations, is a gender gap in political influence.          The estimated gap in overall fund-raising is even larger, because the average contribution from a man is much larger than the average for a woman. For every dollar flowing from big donors into the campaigns of sitting members of Congress, about 76 cents has come from a man and 24 cents from a woman.  These findings are based on an Upshot analysis of data from Crowdpac, a Silicon Valley start-up that tracks donations and rates candidates on an ideological scale. The donors’ gender was determined by their first names. (Less than two percent of donors can’t be reliably mapped to gender.) The data includes only contributions of more than $200, because the names of smaller contributors aren’t disclosed under campaign finance law.  Photo  It’s impossible to know from the way contributions are recorded by campaigns whether a political donation that officially comes from one person actually comes from a married couple. But the name on a political contribution still matters — for access to political figures and influence with them. In an era when big donors demand ever more access to potential future leaders, the gender gap in contributions contributes to a gender gap in political power as well.  What causes the fund-raising gap is harder to pin down. The wage and wealth gap between men and women plays a role. In states where the average woman earns close to the average man’s pay, more of politicians’ big donors are women. The wage gap doesn’t explain the whole fund-raising gap, though.  It’s not that women are less willing or less able to give in general. Despite the wage gap, women, across a variety of demographic variables, are more likely to give to charity than men are. Politics is the outlier, with men’s giving outnumbering women’s.  Continue reading the main story Gender Gap in Campaign Contributions Only a few members of Congress receive more than half of their donations from women. All are women and Democrats, like Representative Jan Schakowsky (the highest percentage). The person who receives the least? Donald Norcross, a New Jersey Democrat. Members of Congress Presidential Candidates Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) Democratic Party average Republican Party average Donald Norcross (D-N.J.) 59.6% 29.1% 23.5% 11.4% Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders Carly Fiorina 52.6% 37.6% 33.3% Members of Congress Presidential Candidates Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.)

Men’s contributions, even among big donors, are likely to be larger than women’s.  Another pattern in the data is that women give more to liberals and to other women. Only a few members of Congress receive more than half of their donations from women. It’s no big surprise that all are women. All are also Democrats.  These patterns are reflected in the presidential primary races, too, but some candidates buck the trends. Hillary Clinton, whose campaign has not been shy about stressing her gender, does well with female donors; more than 52 percent of her 2016 campaign’s big contributors are women. (Her campaign says that 60 percent of all donors are women.) But Bernie Sanders, a self-described feminist, is situated to neutralize some of her natural advantage about as well as any male candidate could. Compared with his fellow male senators, his campaigns for Congress received the highest proportion of its donations from women.  On the Republican side, Carly Fiorina does appear to attract a high percentage of women as donors — but not at the pace that the average Democratic woman does. With a third of her donations so far this cycle from women, she outperforms the average Republican congresswoman by a few percentage points.',1
'DNA OF ANCIENT CHILDREN OFFERS CLUES ON HOW PEOPLE SETTLED THE AMERICAS Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Researchers have long wondered how people settled the Americas, particularly the path they took to the new territory and the timing of their expansion. Until recently, archaeologists studying these questions were limited mostly to digging up skeletons and artifacts.          But now scientists have begun extracting DNA from human bones, and the findings are providing new glimpses at the history of the first Americans. On Monday, researchers at the University of Alaska and elsewhere published an important addition to the growing genetic archive.  In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers reported that they had recovered DNA from two skeletons of children who lived in Alaska 11,500 years ago. The genetic material is not only among the oldest ever found in the Americas, but also the first ancient DNA discovered in Beringia, the region around the Bering Strait where many researchers believe Asians first settled before spreading through North and South America.  The archaeological site, near Upward Sun River, was discovered in 2010. Excavations there have revealed that between 13,200 and 8,000 years ago, people visited during the summer, catching salmon and hares. They built tentlike structures where they made fires and slept.  Photo  In 2011, archaeologists discovered cremated bones on a hearth at the site. Research revealed that the bones belonged to a 3-year-old child. Below the hearth, the team discovered a burial pit containing the skeletons of two other children.  One of the buried children was an infant who died a few months after birth; the other was likely a late-term fetus. After the baby and the fetus died, their bodies were carefully laid atop a bed of red ocher, surrounded by antlers fashioned into hunting darts.  “These things we hardly ever find — it’s a very rare window into the worldview of these people,” said Ben A. Potter, an archaeologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who has led the research at Upward Sun River.  Clearly, the children had been ceremonially buried. But why the two bodies ended up in the same grave is impossible to know. With the consent of Native American tribes that live around the site, Dr. Potter and his colleagues drilled small pieces of bone from the two skeletons and sent them to geneticists at the University of Utah.  The vast majority of our DNA lies in the nucleus of the cell. But the cell’s energy factories, called mitochondria, also carry small bits of their own DNA inherited solely from our mothers.  Because each cell can contain hundreds of mitochondria, it is easier to reconstruct their DNA than that of the cellular nuclei. The Utah geneticists focused their search on mitochondrial DNA in the Upward Sun River bones.  They succeeded in recovering mitochondrial DNA from both bone samples. But to their surprise, the genes were markedly different. The infant and the fetus did not share the same mother or even maternal grandmother.  The researchers can only speculate how an infant and a fetus from different mothers ended up in the same grave. They might have had the same father, or they might have belonged to different families who suffered terrible losses at the same time.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But the significance of the DNA found at Upward Sun River extends far beyond the story of two children. It sheds light on how people first moved into the Americas.  In 2007, Ripan Malhi of the University of Illinois and his colleagues proposed a model for this migration, known as the Beringian Standstill. Early Siberians expanded east into Beringia about 25,000 years ago, they proposed, and stayed there for about 10,000 years.  Humans were able to thrive in Beringia because even at the height of the last ice age, the region was not covered by glaciers. It was mainly tundra and shrub land, with scattered stands of trees.  Humans could not expand eastward into the rest of the Americas because they were blocked by glaciers. About 15,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, the standstill came to an end.  “It opened up new ecological zones that were being colonized by plants and animals,” said Dennis O’Rourke of the University of Utah, a co-author of the new study.  According to the standstill hypothesis, the ancestors of Native Americans would have built up a large degree of genetic diversity in the thousands of years they were confined to Beringia — more so than if these populations had migrated directly from Siberia to the Americas.  The fact that two children who died at roughly the same time in the same community shared so few genes is consistent with the idea that the population was prevented from moving into the Americas for thousands of years, Dr. O’Rourke said.  But the two children died after the glaciers melted, he noted, and their settlement “may well be a remnant of that original Beringian group. It may give us a snapshot of that earlier time.”  Dr. Malhi, who was not involved in the new study, thought the new DNA was too recent to provide proof of the idea that humans were trapped in Beringia for thousands of years. “It’s valuable information, but it’s a little bit late to be extremely informative to let us know if the Beringian Standstill hypothesis holds,” he said.  More conclusive findings would be possible if scientists found older DNA from people who lived during the Beringian Standstill. Archaeologists are now looking for skeletons from that age, but Dr. Malhi is not holding his breath.  Many of the sites where people lived may now be impossible to reach, because sea levels rose at the end of the ice age.  ”There are archaeologists up there looking for such sites,” Dr. Malhi said. “But I think it’s probably unlikely, largely because a lot of Beringia is now under water.”',0
'VIEWPOINT: RAPE CULTURE SHIFTS THE BLAME ONTO WOMEN AND OFF RAPISTS I was 10 when my mom let me know she was withdrawing me from ballet classes and enrolling me in karate instead.  “You need to know how to defend yourself,” she insisted. “There are a lot of bad guys out there who might try to hurt you.”  Her reasoning confused me. I was even more confused when I arrived to my first day of karate and saw that most of the kids taking the class were other 10-year-old girls, like me. Didn’t boys need to protect themselves from the bad guys, too?  As I got older, I learned the reason for her warning: rape culture — a culture in which rape is normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality — plagues our society. And its impact can be traced back to the smallest and most innocuous acts — like withdrawing a 10-year-old girl from dance and enrolling her in karate instead.  Essentially, in rape culture women are taught not to be raped, shifting the blame onto them and away from the men who rape.  Sexual-assault statistics are alarming. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organization that operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline, an American is sexually assaulted every 107 seconds.  The problem is even more pervasive in college. According to a survey of 27 higher education institutions released in September, one in five women will be sexually assaulted during their time in college.  One in five.  In high school, my classmates and I were forced to sit through “Ways to Stay Safe in College” lectures given by our teachers and administrators. While attendance was co-ed, it was clear that girls were the target audience and that the subject the lecturers were working hard to avoid saying was sexual assault.  Their advice? Don’t drink to the point where your judgment is impaired, don’t walk alone at night and never, ever leave your drink unattended.  If you happened to be raped, the lesson seemed to imply, it was because you failed to do one of the above. It was your fault. You hadn’t done all you could to stay safe. You were to blame.  Not once were the boys at my high school simply told, “Do not rape women.”  To me, growing up in a culture of rape meant many things. It meant I never felt safe walking to my car after a long night of studying at the library. It meant my friends and I had to have a “safe word” to discretely notify each other of danger during a night out. It meant I chose my outfits not based on the weather or my mood, but on what wouldn’t arouse men and make them think I was “asking for it.”  Recently, my sinuses were acting up and a doctor recommended I go to a steam room. In hindsight, the experience was pretty run-of-the-mill. But in the moment, paranoia got the best of me.  The steam room at my college, Florida State University, is co-ed. I entered, wearing a sports bra and gym shorts, to find two men sitting inside. I sat as far from them as possible. A few minutes later, three others came in — two sat directly on my left, the other on my right.  At this point, my mind began to race. I found myself plotting my escape. I was in an airless, claustrophobic, hazy room wearing minimal clothing with five men. If I screamed, no one would hear me.  It was a high-risk situation, and if anything happened, it would be my fault. At least that’s what rape culture has taught me.  I decided to leave, my sinuses equally as congested as when I’d arrived.  Rape culture does not have to be an inevitable product of our times. Men need to be taught from a young age that the lines of consent aren’t blurred and that raping someone has consequences.  I have never been raped. That makes me one of the “lucky” ones. But a few days after that steam room, I realized that by getting up and leaving, I, yes, probably made a smart move, but to have blamed myself if I had stayed and something had happened, that would have been a terrible kind of logic. The fact is, it would not have been my fault.',1
'MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL TO BUY STARWOOD HOTELS FOR $12.2B A Marriott hotel in Cranberry Township, Pa. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP)  Marriott International (MAR) has agreed to buy Starwood Hotels and Resorts in a $12.2 billion deal that will make it the largest hotel chain in the world.  The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved a merger agreement, Marriott announced this morning. The combined companies will operate or franchise more than 5,500 hotels with 1.1 million rooms worldwide. About 35% of the properties are outside the USA.  The companies expect the deal to close in mid-2016, following shareholder and regulatory approvals.  Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson will remain CEO of the combined company. The company's headquarters will remain in Bethesda, Md.  Starwood indicated in April that it was seeking to reorganize or sell. Long-time CEO Frits van Paasschen resigned earlier this year.  "The driving force behind this transaction is growth," Sorenson said in a written statement. "This is an opportunity to create value by combining the distribution and strengths of Marriott and Starwood, enhancing our competitiveness in a quickly evolving marketplace."  The merger, he said, "should offer a wider choice of brands to consumers, improve economics to owners and franchisees, increase unit growth and enhance long-term value to shareholders."  The Stamford-Conn.-based Starwood had suffered in recent years because unlike its competitors, it had not grown its brands in North America. Much of its focus had been in expanding its presence overseas. That will serve Marriott well in its own plans to increase its international footprint.  "The combination of our two companies brings together the best in innovation, culture and execution," Starwood CEO Adam Aron said in a written statement. "Our guests and customers will benefit from so many more options across 30 hotel brands, while our hotel owners and franchisees will derive value from our combined global platform and efficiencies."  Starwood has 11 brands, including W Hotels, St. Regis, Westin, and Aloft. The company had been making itself more attractive to a buyer buy creating two new brands this year. The Tribute Portfolio is a collection of four-and five-star independent hotels. Last week, the company expanded a partnership with Design Hotels to bring the Germany-based company into the Starwood portfolio, making it a brand.  Its strength lies in the popularity of its lifestyle brands, which tend to appeal to younger travelers--a consumer group Marriott has aggressively been targeting with the introduction of such brands as AC hotels. Marriott has long been stronger in the luxury and select-service tiers and the convention and resort business.  Starwood's brands will join such Marriott's 19, which include The Ritz-Carlton, Residence Inn, and Courtyard.  The Marriott Rewards program has 54 million members while Starwood Preferred Guest has 21 million.  Under the terms of the agreement, Starwood shareholders will get 0.92 shares of Marriott and $2 in cash for each share of Starwood common stock. Separately, they will also get $7.80 per Starwood share upon completion of a spin-off of the company’s timeshare business to Interval Leisure Group. That is supposed to be completed prior to the Marriott-Starwood merger.  The transaction has a value of $72.08 per Starwood share, including the $2 cash per share.  Starwood shareholders will own approximately 37% of the combined company.​  Shares of Marriott were down 0.3% in pre-market trading and Starwood dropped 4%.',0

'AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY SAYS WOMEN SHOULD START MAMMOGRAMS AT 45 The American Cancer Society has released new breast cancer screening recommendations for women. USA TODAY’s Liz Szabo and Shannon Rae Green discuss the news.

(Photo: Damian Dovarganes, ASSOCIATED PRESS)  Six years ago, the American Cancer Society lashed out against a federal task force that suggested most women could wait to get a mammogram until age 50, instead of age 40, the age that other groups recommended to begin breast cancer screening. Delaying mammograms, the cancer society said, would lead to the death of more women.  Now, in a move that reflects changing attitudes about cancer screening, the American Cancer Society is itself recommending fewer mammograms.  In guidelines released Tuesday, the society said that women at average risk of breast cancer should begin annual mammograms at age 45 – five years later than it had previously recommended. The society said it reached this conclusion after carefully weighing both the benefits and harms of mammograms for younger women, whose risk of breast cancer is much lower than that of older women.  By age 55, women can transition to being screened every other year. That's because breast cancers tend to grow more slowly after menopause, making it safe for women to be checked less often, according to the guidelines, published online Tuesday in JAMA, formerly the Journal of the American Medical Association.  In another major change, the society said doctors no longer need to perform breast exams during women's checkups, since these exams have not been shown to save lives.  These are big changes for the American Cancer Society — the USA's largest cancer charity and perhaps the best-known advocate for screening. As recently as 1992, the American Cancer Society recommended women get a "baseline" mammogram at age 35 to 39, so that doctors would have an image for comparison to their later screening results.  The new guidelines reflect the growing recognition that mammograms can do harm, as well as good, said Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer at the American Cancer Society.  "The biggest evolution has been not in the American Cancer Society, but in the science of cancer screening and the evolution of health care in general," Wender said.  The society now promotes a mammogram schedule adapted to the biology of breast cancer and a woman's changing risk as she ages, Wender said. The society picked age 45 as the start date for screening because that's when a woman's risk of breast cancer begins to spike. Before that, a woman is more likely to be hurt than helped by mammograms, which can produce "false positive" results that may lead women to undergo unnecessary follow-up tests, including invasive biopsies.  A less common, but far more serious, problem caused by mammograms is "overdiagnosis," which occurs when screening tests detect slow-growing cancers that may never to threaten a woman's life. Because doctors can't tell which breast tumors are essentially harmless, they end up treating all of them. That can lead women to undergo surgery, radiation or other treatments they don't need. Although studies have estimated that up to half of breast cancers don't need to be treated, the cancer society now says that the true number is between 1% to 10%. The cancer society estimates that nearly 232,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 and more than 40,000 will die from it.  The cancer society's last update on mammograms, published in 2003, barely mentioned overdiagnosis, finding "little to no evidence" for it.  "We're moving to an era where people are recognizing the limitations of screening tests," said Nancy Keating, a primary care physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who co-wrote an accompanying editorial in JAMA. "For many years, we convinced everybody, including doctors, that mammograms are the best tests and everyone has to have one. But now we're acknowledging that the benefits are modest and the harms are real."  The recommendations are only for women at average risk of breast cancer, rather than those with a family history, genetic mutations or other factors that put them at higher risk. Women under age 45 who feel strongly about mammograms can continue to get them, as can women over 55 who want to be screened every year, Wender said. The cancer society is planning to publish screening guidelines for women at high risk of breast cancer in the future.  That part of the guidelines also reflects a growing trend in medicine: helping patients make informed decisions, rather than dictating to them, Wender said.  Some medical groups still urge earlier mammograms. The American College of Radiology and Society for Breast Imaging, whose members interpret mammograms, continue to recommend women get annual mammograms beginning at 40.  "If you want to save the most lives, that's the recommendation that will do it," said physician Debra Monticciolo, chair of the American College of Radiology's breast imaging commission.  These conflicting recommendations — with different medical groups recommending that screening start at 40, 45 or 50 — could "add to the confusion" about mammograms, said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition.

(Photo: Torin Halsey, AP)  Both men and women have heard changing messages in recent years, as doctors increasingly take a "less is more" approach to tests.  Three years ago, the American Cancer Society recommended that cervical cancer screenings — once a staple of a woman's annual checkup — could be safely done every three to five years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — the advisory panel whose 2009 mammogram advice caused such a stir — has said that men can skip prostate cancer screening entirely. And a campaign called Choosing Wisely — whose members include dozens of medical specialty groups -- has highlighted hundreds of tests and procedures that can cause harm when used inappropriately.  Most women overestimate how much mammograms actually help, said Lisa Schwartz, a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in New Hampshire. Mammograms reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by as little as 15% to as much as 40%, depending on which studies people consider.  That means that 85% of women in their 40s and 50s who die of breast cancer would have died whether or not they were screened, said Keating, a professor at Harvard Medical School.  The cancer society once cast screening as a black-and-white choice between life and death, Schwartz said. In the 1980s, the American Cancer Society ran ads telling women, "If you haven't had a mammogram, you need more than your breasts examined."  The message, Schwartz said, "was that you're an irresponsible person if you don't get screened." Three decades after those ads appeared, many doctors still convey that message and many women still believe it, Schwartz said.  Those kinds of messages are outdated, Wender said.  In the future, the American Cancer Society will never tell women that "a choice to do more or less screening is anything less than an expression of a woman's personal beliefs and values."  MAMMOGRAMS RISKS AND BENEFITS  Although mammograms can save lives, their benefits are much more modest than many women assume. They also carry risks.

'ALZHEIMER'S WORSENS TWICE AS FAST IN WOMEN, STUDY FINDS Facebook  Twitter  Google Plus  Embed 2:01 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog  Women with memory problems that may signal early Alzheimer's descend into dementia twice as fast as men, researchers said Tuesday.  It helps explain why so many more women than men have Alzheimer's disease, they said. Two-thirds of Americans suffering from Alzheimer's are women.  Women in their 60s are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as they are to get breast cancer, the Alzheimer's Association says.  It may have something to do with the biology of the brain, researchers told the annual Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C.  "We haven't done enough work parsing out some of the gender differences," said Kristine Yaffe of the University of California San Francisco. Women are more likely to have depression, a risk factor for Alzheimer's, and women are more vulnerable to stress, another risk factor.  "Probably what this is going to be about is a complicated interaction between genetics, hormones and the way the brain develops," Yaffe said.  Some studies are shedding just a little light on what may be happening.  "Our findings suggest that men and women at risk of Alzheimer's may be having two very different experiences."  Katherine Lin of Duke University and colleagues studied 400 people with mild cognitive impairment — a loss of memory and thinking skills that doesn't yet strongly affect someone's life but that can become Alzheimer's.  They used an 11-part test that's routine for diagnosing memory loss and Alzheimer's. Women, they found, declined at a rate of more than two points a year on the test, compared to men who declined at a rate of just over one point a year.  "Our findings suggest that men and women at risk of Alzheimer's may be having two very different experiences," said Lin, a student at Duke who said she become interested in Alzheimer's research after a female relative was diagnosed with the disease.  Facebook  Twitter  Google Plus  Embed 4:58 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog  Some other researchers say they have hints about what may be going on.  Dr. Katie Schenning of Oregon Health & Science University and colleagues found that the combination of surgery and anesthesia could affect brain volume and thinking - and that women are more affected by this than men.  It didn't matter what type of anesthesia it was, Schenning told a news conference. "Women exposed to surgery and anesthesia had a more rapid rate of decline…than men exposed to anesthesia," she said.  Her team studied 527 people, 182 of whom had surgery with anesthesia. They had comparable years of education and were equally likely to have the APOE4 gene, which puts people at a higher risk of Alzheimer's.  People often come out of anesthesia with confusion, an effect that usually wears off fairly quickly. But some people never quite recover. This happened to both men and women, but it measurable declines came faster in women and women had more evidence of brain shrinkage after surgery than men did, Schenning's team found.  "It was not just anesthesia but the combination of surgery and anesthesia," Schenning said. Her team couldn't see a different between different types of anesthetics but she said that would be an important thing to look at. In the meantime, people considering elective surgery should discuss this risk with their doctors, she said.  Dr. Michael Weiner of the University of California San Francisco has another piece of the puzzle. His team did PET scans of people's brains, and found women in general have more of the brain-clogging protein called amyloid that is a hallmark of Alzheimer's.  "Women have more amyloid in the brain than men even when you adjust for other factors."  His team looked at 1,000 people: 273 normal people, 557 with mild cognitive impairment and 145 who had diagnosed Alzheimer's.  "Women have more amyloid in the brain than men even when you adjust for other factors," Weiner told a news conference.  Having the APOE4 gene did not seem to matter for women - they still had more amyloid in their brains, and this effect became much greater once they had Alzheimer's.  Dr. Roberta Brinton of the University of Southern California says much more work needs to be done on sex differences in the brain. She led a three-day workshop of experts who agreed that hormones such as estrogen and testosterone must play a role, although it's not clear at all what, precisely, that role is. Women also have metabolic differences, she said, and it may be that women are affected differently by diet and exercise than men are.  It's clear that exercise and a healthy diet do affect people's risk of Alzheimer's.  More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease now. The Alzheimer's Association says more than 28 million baby boomers will develop the disease between now and 2050, and the cost of caring for them will consume nearly 25 percent of Medicare spending in 2040.',1

'WOMEN WHO CHANGED SCIENCE, MEDICINE, TECHNOLOGY (CNN) For decades, stories have gone largely untold about world-changing accomplishments by dozens of female pioneers in science, medicine and technology.  Author Rachel Swaby's 2015 book, "Headstrong: 52 Women who Changed Science-and the World," sheds fresh light on these fascinating women who pushed themselves to succeed in fields that were overwhelmingly male-dominated.  Anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar, for example, climbed the career ladder during a time when anesthesiology wasn't recognized as a medical specialty.  "Virginia Apgar had such amazing energy and such an energetic mind," Swaby said.  For eleven years she directed the anesthesia division at New York's Presbyterian Hospital. But in 1949, when her division was upgraded to a department, she was passed over for the chair position in favor of a male colleague.  Science and technology For more about the cutting edge of science, technology and medicine go to CNN.com/Pioneers.  So Apgar moved on to work with infants.  She found that there was no standard of comparison for newborns. Without a method for judging comparatively the overall health of new babies, many would go home with undiagnosed problems that doctors failed to recognize.  For mothers, the name Apgar will likely ring a bell.  Apgar invented the APGAR scoring system (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration), which doctors around the world use daily to determine newborn baby health. Before its introduction in the 1950s, there was no standardized way to compare the health of newborns. "It was a huge public health breakthrough," Swaby said.  Within the first five minutes of birth, babies are rated from zero to ten on the five different criteria.  She went on to shift the March of Dimes from a polio-fighting organization to one that focuses on health problems of infants.    Related: Gene 'editing' may solve Alzheimer's  Making workplaces healthier  Another female science pioneer, toxicologist Alice Hamilton, used unusual research methods to reveal unhealthy conditions in factories.  In the early 1900s, while researching lead poisoning in factories, Hamilton found that managers preferred to hire men with families. Family men had more to lose if they were fired for being sick. These men fought harder to keep working through their bouts with lead poisoning, Hamilton discovered, because they could least afford to lose their jobs.  "She's one of my favorites," Swaby said "The way that she did her science reminds me a lot of reporting." She targeted lead-using industries and personally visited plants where she conducted interviews.  When plant managers caught on to her research, they banned her from their factories. So, she would get her evidence elsewhere, by going to hospitals and pulling medical records, Swaby said. Eventually "she became the foremost expert on industrial health in the United States."  Her work resulted in a long list of manufacturing processes that involved using lead inside buildings. Many of these buildings were "dilapidated and improperly vented, with lead dust clouding the air."  Hamilton's expertise was enough to lure Harvard Medical School to hire her as its first female faculty member in 1919. "Until that time, Harvard didn't take on women faculty, so when it did, it was a big scandal," Swaby said. "She wasn't allowed to use the faculty lounge or to walk in commencement. But she got a warm welcome otherwise."  She helped pass a state law in Illinois to compensate workers who were exposed to harmful substances in the workplace.  Her work sparked revolutions in the way insurance companies, plants, and the state treated industrial workers.  Related: Growing bones in a laboratory  A secret laboratory for a Nobel Prize winner  During World War II, an Italian science pioneer by the name of Rita Levi-Montalcini rode a bicycle door to door pleading with farmers for chicken eggs to "feed her babies."  By "feeding her babies" she meant continuing her secret embryonic research.  The Italian government barred her from medical research on the grounds that she was Jewish, so Levi-Montalcini partnered with her brother to create a clandestine laboratory in her basement. The lab was outfitted with a homemade incubator and tiny instruments (think filed-down needles as scalpels) to work on chick embryos.  Her underground research led to the discovery that nerve cells grow and die like all other cells. Previously it was thought that nerve cells simply fail to multiply. After the war, Levi-Montalcini continued her work more publicly with partner Stanley Cohen.  The pair uncovered breakthroughs with nerve growth in degenerative disease progression, successful skin grafts, and protecting damaged spinal cords.  Their work earned them both the Nobel Prize in Physiology. Levi-Montalcini received the National Medal of Science and was appointed a senator-for-life in Italy.  The fact that these women aren't famous outside their fields, Swaby said, is a lost opportunity that would encourage girls to pursue careers in science and technology.  "We could talk more about the history of women in science in our schools," Swaby said. "It would be really great to have some of these stories told as girls are growing up and learning about science."  Including the stories of these women in school curriculum would teach young students "that there's a long history of women making amazing breakthroughs in the sciences and that there are places for them in every field of science."

'THE LATEST: WOMEN EARN ONLY 74 CENTS A DOLLAR Women in America need a raise.  Yet another study has found overwhelming evidence that men get paid more than women.  The pay gap exists even when male and female workers have the same job with the same qualifications.  Overall, American women earn just 74 cents for every $1 a man earns, PayScale found after looking at data from over a million people.  Other startling findings from the report include:  There's no industry where women earn the same or more than men.  There's no state where women earn more than men.  The gap gets worse the higher up the job ladder you go.  "This isn't a women's issue, this is a family, community and economic issue," says Victoria Budson, executive director of the Harvard Kennedy School's Women and Public Policy Program. "When women are paid less, it means you have less dollars going into Main Street."  Related: Looking for a better job? Try the Steve Jobs approach  Women even paid less for same work  A key issue is that the most common jobs for women pay less than the typical male jobs.  In America, women are more likely to be social workers, secretaries and nurses, while men are more often employed as managers, engineers and IT workers.  But there's still a gap even when men and women have the same job. It's smaller, but it persists.  PayScale found American women earn 97 cents to the $1 men earn even when everything -- job title, industry, experience, location and whether they have kids -- is equal.  "It's really disconcerting how slowly it's changing even though companies know there is implicit bias," says Ariane Hegewisch, a study director at the Institute for Women's Policy Research.  Related: The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights  The gap gets bigger in the C-suite  When people start working fresh out of school, the gap is low. But it grows over time. By the time women hit the top management levels, the pay differential widens.  "Why is the pay gap wider at the executive level? You would assume women making it to that level are great negotiators. So I think there are a lot more factors at play," says Lydia Frank, senior editorial director at PayScale.  Only 5% of CEOs in the S&P 500 are women, according to a CNNMoney analysis. Even when you look across the "C-suite" -- at the top five positions at each company -- only 16.5% of those leadership roles are held by women.  Experts say the problem is two-fold: women aren't advancing to more senior roles at the same rates than men and they aren't getting paid as much even when they do get there.  "Women tend to pay a higher professional cost for even requesting the raise," says Frank.  Related: Women in the world: Where the U.S. falters in quest for equality  The gender gap is worse for minorities  While many Americans are aware of that women earn about 75 to 80 cents to the dollar that men get, minority women receive even less pay.  "Women are not a monolithic group. There are gender gaps in the U.S.," says Budson of Harvard's Women and Public Policy Program.  African-American women only make about 64 cents for every dollar a white man makes and Hispanic women fare even worse -- only about 54 cents for every dollar a white male earns.

'KENYA: THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE PREGNANT Mandera, Kenya (CNN) The hospital in this remote region of Kenya has no blood in its blood bank, and Fardowsa Abdi is about to die.  The 25-year-old went into labor days ago.  But with no medical facilities close to her home near Kenya's border with Somalia, she had to travel 300 kilometers (186 miles) to reach this hospital.  It's the only free one in a county with a million people spread over an area nearly the size of Connecticut or Belgium.  Abdinoor Mohamad Abdi's mother did not survive his birth, leaving him to be raised by his grandmother Halima Somo Dima  Now she's hemorrhaging after a cesarean section. She winces in pain as she nurses her baby.  Abdi has been dealt a difficult card. She lives in Kenya's Mandera county -- the most dangerous place in the world to give birth.  "It's tragic," says Ruth Sambu, a maternity nurse at Mandera County Referral Hospital. "And then the worst part is that, as a person who is knowledgeable, there is little you can do."  Women here are nearly 10 times more likely to die in childbirth than they are in Afghanistan.  It's 135 times more dangerous to be pregnant here than in the United States.  About 38 mothers die in childbirth in Mandera County for every 1,000 live births, according to the United Nations -- two to three women a day.  Mutilation and terror  "Nobody talks about it," women's activist Ubah Ibrahim says. "The reason as to why (it is so dangerous to give birth) -- is mostly because of female circumcision. Every day it happens. Also, there are very few doctors left in Mandera because of insecurity, and not many good facilities."  The al Qaeda-linked insurgent group Al-Shabaab has attacked Mandera multiple times, murdering dozens of civilians.  Humanitarian agencies and international donors, including the World Food Programme, have pulled out or withdrawn support due to the insecurity.  That has left the remaining medical staff overwhelmed.  "It gets quite busy, quite busy. Like you can have three mothers giving birth at the same time," Sambu says.  And some of those mothers should not be pregnant in the first place, the nurses say.  The nurses spoke of child brides, women too young for their bodies to bear children.  They described women hemorrhaging, and yet still refusing cesarean sections, fearing that it would cut down on future fertility in polygamist society where some women measure their worth by the number of children they can give their husbands.  And then there is female genital mutilation, common in the region, performed on girls as young as nine years old. They are then sent to recover from the bleeding in the bush, as Sambu says, "with only a man to keep the hyenas away."  Impact Your World: How you can help stop FGM  Deadly results  When it comes time for women to give birth, the mutilation can bring about terrible consequences.  Halima Hussein with her sixth baby -- the first one to survive, after five miscarriages.  "You would get the baby dying because of obstruction at the vaginal wall," says Sambu.  If the baby gets stuck, the child -- and possibly the mother -- will die.  But some help is slowly trickling into Mandera.  The U.N. Population Fund, U.N. Development Program and Kenyan First Lady Margaret Kenyatta's office have launched an initiative called "Beyond Zero."  So far, they have donated fully equipped mobile maternity clinics to 32 of Kenya's 47 counties, containing the medical supplies women need to give birth safely.  The U.N. Population Fund says the mobile clinics have helped more than 130,000 Kenyan women and children.  Margaret Kenyatta came to Mandera in early November to donate one.  Blood donation  That was the day Fardowsa Abdi needed emergency surgery in order to survive.  Her blood type was B negative, which is rare. It happens to be the same as mine.  As journalists we are often confronted with problems that appear unsolvable. Issues so mammoth, situations so out of control that it is almost unfathomable to even think about trying to help. But here I could, so I did.  Gestures like my blood donation, or even a mobile maternity clinic, can make only a tiny difference in a region that is missing the most basic of necessities, where the smallest acts can quite literally make the difference between life and death.  A week after her emergency operation, Fardowsa Abdi was still recovering in the hospital -- and she told a nurse she was planning to have more children.',1
'CAN THE IPAD PRO REPLACE THE LAPTOP? True productivity is a mess. Stacks of open applications, browsers crowded with tabs, ongoing chat conversations pushed to the edge of the screen.  Laptop replacement is just one of many possible uses for the 12.9-inch super-powered iPad. It has the required processing power and a stunning screen, but as a serious work device, it's not there yet. Despite the "Pro" in its name, it's a better fit for more casual laptop users.  There are a few areas where the device doesn't quite make the leap from tablet to laptop: the premature death of the mouse, lack of full-featured software, and multitasking.  Ergonomics  The iPad Pro dreams of a world without that little arrow cursor, where you just touch buttons and windows. Who hasn't absentmindedly reached up to tap their computer screen, only to feel embarrassed and maybe a little disappointed?  Unfortunately for the iPad, we are not yet post-mouse. The official Apple keyboard supports some common shortcuts, but has no trackpad. This creates a frustrating (and tiring) mishmash of hand movements.  When you're in the zone on a laptop, your arms barely move and your fingers fly across the keyboard and trackpad, executing familiar shortcuts and movements. On the iPad Pro, you're constantly pausing to reach up. It sounds minor, and maybe it will become second nature over time, but it's a distracting and unfortunate design.  Software  All existing iPad apps work on the iPad Pro. The most interesting options are apps that have been updated to work with the Apple Pencil, the optional stylus. If you don't need any heavy-duty apps, or use custom company software, then there's a chance you can do everything you need on an iPad.  Developers love to make iOS apps. Unfortunately, they're usually lightweight versions of popular professional software. Adobe has multiple Photoshop iOS apps. They're great for someone dabbling in photography, but they won't work for professional photographers. Same goes for other industries. Really great mobile versions are just not good enough to use full time for work.  Operating system  The latest version of iOS has made huge strides in productivity, and the iPad Pro has some multitasking options. If you want to run two apps side by side or watch a video while you work, then the iPad Pro is a good option (if $799 is in your price range). But for most, these features aren't enough to mimic the laptop experience.  Maybe iOS on the iPad Pro is a vision of how we should work. Focused on one thing at a time, two max.  But even accepting its limited view of multitasking, Apple's iOS still has a lot of work to do before it catches up to laptops as a tool for pro users.  That pencil  It's really great! If you're thinking of moving from a pencil-based workflow to a laptop, this is a fantastic upgrade. It feels as close to writing on paper as possible, plus there's an entire world of options like 3D modeling, painting, and design.  Related: Who is the iPad Pro for?

'US WARPLANES DESTROY 116 ISIS FUEL TRUCKS IN SYRIA U.S. aircraft have destroyed 116 fuel trucks used by ISIS to generate income for its operations, which is part of an expansion of the U.S.-led coalition's targeting of ISIS' oil-smuggling operations.  The airstrikes today in Syria and broadening of targets involved in ISIS' oil-smuggling operations were planned before the Paris terror attacks.  Launched almost a month ago, Operation Tidal Wave II has increased the coalition's targeting of ISIS' fuel operations that continue to generate millions of dollars a month in income for the terror group. As part of the broadened targeting coalition, aircraft have struck oil fields and oil and gas-generating plants in eastern Syria.  Today’s strikes targeted for the first time a gathering area for the hundreds of fuel trucks used to transport ISIS oil. Until now, the coalition had refrained from targeting the fuel trucks in an effort to minimize civilian casualties.  "One strike destroyed 116 ISIL fuel trucks” near Abu Kamal, which is located near Dayr al Zawr, according to the coalition's daily airstrike summary released. The Pentagon believes that area of eastern Syria is where the heart of ISIS’ oil operation is located and generates as much as two-thirds of its oil revenue.  In an effort to minimize potential civilian casualties, two F-15 fighter jets dropped leaflets an hour prior to the airstrike , warning drivers to leave the almost-300 vehicles gathered in the target area.  Four A-10 aircraft and two AC-130 gunships were used to bomb and strafe the vehicles.  From the very beginnings of the air campaign against ISIS, the U.S.-led coalition has targeted the terror group's oil-smuggling operations by striking infrastructure targets like mobile oil platforms.  But Col. Steve Warren, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, told Pentagon reporters last week that despite the sustained strikes, ISIS was able to repair targeted facilities in short order.  "We'd conduct a strike against some piece of the oil infrastructure, and then within, you know, 24, 48, 72 hours, the enemy have managed to repair that piece of infrastructure, and were back up and running."  A month ago the coalition launched Operation Tidal Wave II, a broadened campaign to target ISIS' oil operations that would strike additional targets and keep them out of commission for extended periods of time.  The operation began Oct. 21 when coalition aircraft conducted a strike on the Omar oil fields in eastern Syria. Since then, there has been additional targeting of gas and oil-separation plants and strikes in the Tanak oil field in eastern Syria.  "What we've done is we've used very precise carving, a very detailed analysis to strike certain parts of these facilities that will cause them to shut down for an extended period of time," Col. Warren said, the result of needing replacement parts that are much harder for ISIS to obtain.',0
'UTAH HOSPITAL WARNS 4,800 PEOPLE OF POSSIBLE HEPATITIS C EXPOSURE A Utah hospital is warning 4,800 former patients that they may have been exposed to a rare type of hepatitis C virus and is urging them to get tested.  Officials from Utah Health Department said that they believe a former employee of the McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, Utah may have exposed patients when she was working in the Emergency Department.  A spokeswoman for the health department said the employee had been diverting drugs for her use and officials believe that by using drugs she may have exposed patients to the virus. She has since been fired from the hospital, according to hospital officials.  "We want to make sure that we're being thorough in our approach," McKay-Dee Hospital spokesman Chris Dallin told ABC News. "The chance of getting hepatitis C is low."  Health officials started an investigation after a patient had the same rare type of the hepatitis C virus as a nurse who worked in the emergency room.  Ogden police told ABC News affiliate KTVX that the nurse admitted she had used drugs.  "The suspect had come forward to her employer. The employer had brought the information to us, she was ultimately charged with several counts of possession of a controlled substance and theft," Ogden Police Lt. Danielle Croyle told KTVX-TV.  Hepatitis C is a virus usually spread from blood contact either by sharing needles, receiving donated blood or using contaminated equipment. In a hospital, the disease is a usually spread via a needle stick accident, according to a health department spokeswoman.  The Utah Health Department said only patients who visited the emergency department at McKay Dee Hospital between June 17, 2013 and November 25, 2014, and received certain medications, should consider getting tested.',0
'IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF FRIDA KAHLO: HOW IS LIFE CHANGING FOR MEXICO CITY'S WOMEN? In any discussion about how life is changing for women in Mexico City, one name looms large. Described as “the most famous female artist in history” by Tate Modern, Frida Kahlo’s rise to full international icon occurred a half-century after her death. But her enduring importance to many as a key Mexican feminist is reflected in the floods of women (and men) who continue to visit La Casa Azul, her cobalt blue-walled former home in the city’s Coyoacán district.  On the morning I visit the house (in 1958 it became the Frida Kahlo Museum), I encounter a trio of trainee women teachers from Vancouver, Canada, who are reflecting on Kahlo’s 1932 painting Henry Ford Hospital, which, with trademark candour, portrays the miscarriage Kahlo suffered while in Detroit.  “It seems as if a lot of women wouldn’t talk about it, the issue was very taboo,” says Danielle Logan of the bloodstained self-portrait. “Still to this day, a lot of women feel stigma around miscarriage. Frida is the first person to put it into art, and make a topic like this accessible to a wider group of people.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A visitor sits in the courtyard of the Frida Kahlo Museum. Photograph: Jose Luis Magana/AP  “Look at this painting, and how Frida was feeling,” says Danielle’s friend, Emily Nickason. “There is so much stigma attached to these things; it’s really important that she made it art. It says it’s OK that you feel those things too.”  For the women at the museum, Kahlo represents values such as “empowerment”, “freedom”, “independence”, “honesty” and “being true to yourself”. Or, as the director of the museum, Hilda Trujillo, puts it: “Frida did what she wanted. She was brave in a very conservative society. Young women today identify with Frida; they find strength in her, and they identify with that strength.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Giselle Peña with daughter Mercedes at the museum. Photograph: Camilla Brett  With a major feature film based on a best-selling book of her life, a record-breaking $5.6m (£3.7m) sale for a work of Latin American art, and devotees from Madonna to Isabella Rossellini, Kahlohas become a 21st-century cultural icon. Yet at her death in 1954, she was hardly known outside her native Mexico. Her rising importance over the past three decades is perhaps due to fascination with her personal life, and the intimate way in which she documented its challenges as a woman and an artist.  I meet Giselle Peña, whose main reason for coming to Mexico City from San Diego is to visit Kahlo’s former home with her daughter, Mercedes, and son, Xavier. “Although I hope Mexico isn’t as conservative as it used to be, it really still is,” Peña tells me. “I think that women are still taught to serve the man, and to be the pillar in the family – everyone leans on the woman.”  Peña says she particularly wanted to visit Kahlo’s home with her daughter because she had been unable to discuss certain issues with her own mother. “In society, women are taught to be not as outspoken, to take a certain amount of grief in your life because that’s what you are supposed to do. But Frida didn’t.”  For psychology student Myriam Ramos, who works for a progressive Catholic NGO, some ways in which the city has been changing for women are very positive. “There have been improvements in the law like the decriminalisation of abortion in Mexico City,” she says. “Women here still have to go through the stigmas and pressures of their families if they decide to have an abortion, but at least now they have access to safe and clean procedures – whereas the women outside this city still undertake huge risks.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Actress Maya Zapata: ‘We are sexualised by the system.’ Photograph: Elina Simonen  The actress Maya Zapata agrees: “There have been some changes against certain attitudes towards women here in Mexico City, and hopefully this might influence the rest of the country, as cities can be a catalyst of progress and forward thinking.”  Yet many day-to-day experiences in Mexico City are troubling for both women. “There is a world apart between some wealthy areas of the city and some not so wealthy,” says Ramos. “The other day, I went out with some friends to a high-to-middle-class area of the city. It was a hot day, I was wearing a short dress, and I felt very comfortable – I had no issues all day. But on my way back home on the bus (I live in a not so wealthy area of Mexico City), I immediately started to feel uncomfortable. Two men got on the bus followed by two young girls wearing leggings, and these men were all over them. Then, when the girls got off the bus, the men moved over to me and carried on saying things.  Student Myriam Ramos: ‘I receive lots of verbal abuse.’ Photograph: Camilla Brett  “I remember that I used to take public transport when I was in high school, and it was not a pleasant experience. The buses would be packed and you always ended up being squashed and groped – it was like being abused in public and nobody would say anything, not even other women. Having lived through that, now I don’t want to give up these improvements so I defend them – but I receive lots of verbal abuse by doing so.”  Zapata, too, is conscious that much still needs to change: “My mother, by sheer chance, ended up becoming an actress after working first for the costume department in Televisa. But because she was a woman of a certain class – she is morena, or brown-skinned – she could only work interpreting roles of maids in telenovelas; she wasn’t allowed to do anything else. And that is something that has changed very little: the colour of your skin can still determine the whole of your life. Perhaps there is a little bit more consciousness, but it’s still very much the case nowadays.  “In terms of class, there is a huge sector of the population which isn’t represented at all, and these are the people with little money and of a darker skin colour. As an actress, I have noticed that this type of discrimination intensifies even more when you are a woman; we are sexualised by the system. I’ve sometimes tried to speak out against some of these things, and I’ve been called a ‘feminazi’, ‘feminoid’ – all sorts of names”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frida Kahlo fabric being sold at an evening market in Coyoacán. Photograph: Alamy  Born in 1907 in Coyoacán, Kahlo was a marginalised voice for many reasons: she was a woman, an invalid after polio during childhood left her with a damaged leg, the child of migrant and indigenous ancestry (her mother was a devout Catholic of Spanish-indigenous descent, her father a German-Hungarian immigrant) – and it was from these limitations that she somehow found the freedom to break every rule and be true to herself.  As an 18 year-old student planning to study for a medical degree, Kahlo had an accident that almost killed her. A trolley car collided with a bus in which she was travelling and a metal handrail punctured her abdomen, splintering her pelvis, shattering her spinal column and collarbone, and leaving her already damaged leg broken in 22 places.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Industrial engineer Iris Salazar at the museum. Photograph: Camilla Brett  Over her lifetime she would face more than 30 operations, and become dependent on medication and alcohol to manage the pain. But perhaps the most devastating effect of the crash was Kahlo’s inability to bear children. The early years of her marriage to the preeminent muralist and painter Diego Rivera were marked by multiple miscarriages, which she documented with an honesty that is astonishing even today.  Rivera described his wife as “the first woman in the history of art to treat, with absolute and uncompromising honesty, one might even say impassive cruelty, those general and specific themes which exclusively affect women”. Perhaps it is because Kahlo’s work peels back the deepest layers of her being, expressing her self-discovery in such a direct and visceral way, that her message appears universal to a modern society that is obsessed with self-disclosure.  “Kahlo must have felt so powerless in her [sick] bed, but in her portraits she had that power,” one of the Canadian trainee teachers tells me. “The power over her self-image, of how the world sees and understands you, it was in her hands.”  For Iris Salazar, an industrial engineer, Kahlo is “an icon for both men and women. She just did what she wanted, she dressed as she wanted, she claimed her heritage in the way she wanted. Her way of living is something we aspire to; to do nothing else except from what you want to do. I don’t know a woman, or man, who wouldn’t like to be a little bit like Frida.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frida Kahlo’s bedroom has been preserved for visitors to La Casa Azul. Photograph: Frida Kahlo Museum  According to Trujillo: “Frida represents the duality of human nature. She wrote beautifully but swore profusely when she spoke, she is full of contradictions. She’s become a symbol for modern women, as she didn’t respect social conventions, she did what she wanted. She represents the values of a contemporary woman: she is free, independent, and is not overcome by anything.”  If that is true, has the city where she was born and spent most of her life learned from her example? Ramos is dubious: “There has been a very big campaign to sell Mexico, and Mexico City itself, as a great tourist destination. This is the most modern city in Latin America but also the poorest, so it’s all about showing off but not really dealing with its problems. It has brought good changes like equal marriage and women-only sections on public transport – yet I have arguments with men sitting in that section who do not want to move. Some have become verbally abusive but I tell them, ‘sorry, it’s not your section’.  “Men have difficulty thinking of women as equals and to give them their place, especially in the lower economic levels of society like where I live. The rules that exist for women here are very deeply embedded in society, and it’s the families of these women that put pressure on them. Can you imagine Frida’s family putting pressure on her for deciding to live in a separate house to her husband? That’s the change I’m waiting for – a change in the mentality of our society.”  Camilla Brett is an arts and culture consultant based in Mexico City. She directs and produces theatre and has recently founded Prospero Teatro Mexico.',1
'NEW YORK PLASTIC SURGEON PERFORMS 'MOST EXTENSIVE' FACE TRANSPLANT EVER A plastic surgeon at New York University’s Langone Medical Center has performed the “most extensive” facial transplant ever.  Related: Face transplants – a short history  Dr Eduardo Rodriguez performed the transplant over 26 hours in August. In that time, he gave a 41-year-old former firefighter from Tennessee, Patrick Hardison, the face of David Rodebaugh, a 26-year-old bike mechanic from Brooklyn who became braindead after a cycling accident this summer.  The procedure and the stories of the two men’s lives were extensively detailed in a piece written for New York magazine by Steve Fishman and published on Sunday.  Hardison was badly burned when responding to a house fire in Senatobia, Mississippi, on 5 September 2001. He was given the semblance of a face with flesh transferred from his thighs, but in the years leading up to his surgery at Langone he underwent 71 operations at a rate of seven a year and became dependent on painkillers, wrecking his family life.    Of his appearance before the transplant, Hardison told Fishman: “Kids ran screaming and crying when they saw me. There are things worse than dying.”  Facial transplants are not common, but they have been performed around the world for 10 years. The first partial facial transplant was performed in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, a 38-year-old French woman who had been bitten by a dog. The first such operation in the US was performed in December 2008 on Connie Culp, a 46-year-old Cleveland woman who was shot by her husband four years earlier.  In Spain in 2010, a 31-year-old man named only as Oscar, a farmer who accidentally shot himself in the face, was given what was then described as the world’s first full facial transplant.  In the US in 2011, surgeons at Brigham and Women’s hospital in Boston gave a new nose, lips, skin, muscle and nerves to Dallas Wiens, a 25-year-old construction worker from Texas who was disfigured in an accident involving power lines. That operation was paid for by the US military. It could not restore his sight.  Rodebaugh’s face was the third offered to Hardison, who met the pioneering Dr Rodriguez in 2012. The first was from a Hispanic man, whose family withdrew consent. The second was from a woman, which Hardison declined. Rodebaugh’s face was offered through LiveOnNY, the New York organ donor network.  In the New York magazine piece, Fishman details the delicate, exhausting and perilous procedure which Dr Rodriguez followed – which he warned his patient would be “the most extensive face transplant yet performed”.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Fishman’s piece Biography of a Face is published in the new issue of New York magazine. Photograph: New York magazine  “Two days after [Rodebaugh] was declared braindead,” he writes, “at 7.30am on 14 August, the surgery began. Rodriguez started on Rodebaugh, carefully dissecting the half-inch-thick scalp away from the skull. He worked from the back toward the ears, then the nose, which he sawed off. The trick was to cut away the tissue while preserving nerves, muscles and the carotid arteries and the internal jugular veins – the ‘big pipes’.”  The procedure was not without drama, as Hardison’s jugular vein proved to be bigger than that which had belonged to Rodebaugh, causing Hardison to lose blood dangerously. Dr Rodriguez improvised, inserting one jugular into a minutely cut hole in the side of the other.  Hardison is now recovering. He will take immunosuppressant drugs for his life, and Dr Rodriguez told Fishman “there will be a rejection – not if but when”. Dr Rodriguez estimated that between three and five of the other patients who have received facial transplants around the world died after the new tissue was rejected.  One of Hardison’s sons, though, told Fishman: “When I see his face, I want to memorise it, so the next time I see him, I know it’s my dad.”',0
'NEW SMARTPHONE BATTERY CAN CHARGE TO 48% IN FIVE MINUTES A smartphone battery that lasts longer than a day might be out of reach of most people for the moment, but a large one that charges to 48% in five minutes is on the way.    Huawei’s new fast-charging battery is capable of charging 10 times faster than that of normal lithium ion batteries and uses a new electrode design, according to the company.  The batteries were developed by the Huawei-owned Watt Lab, and were demonstrated at the 56th Battery Symposium in Japan last week.  Quick charging 3,000mAh battery demonstration.  The new batteries have a catalyst built into the anode that speeds up the conversion of electrical energy from the grid into chemical energy without shortening the battery’s life or reducing the amount of energy it can store.  Two types of batteries were on show. One 3,000 milliampere-hour (mAh) battery that could be charged to 48% in five minutes and a smaller 600mAh battery that hit 68% in two minutes.  For comparison, Google’s Nexus 6P phablet has a 3,450mAh battery while Apple’s iPhone 6S has a 1,715mAh battery. Current quick-charging, such as those using Qualcomm’s Quick Charge or the faster charging capability built into the new USB-C connector takes around an hour to fully charge a large smartphone battery.  Quick charging 600mAh battery demonstration.  The technology was demonstrated using batteries that fitted into a smartphone, but which use standalone chargers. Huawei expects to be able to integrate the chargers directly into smartphones in the near future.  Battery technology has lagged behind the rapid advancements made in processing power and other areas of technology, becoming the major hold up and primary pain point for smartphone users.  Part of the problem has been the limitations of the chemistry of the batteries. Producing cells capable of storing more energy safely and reliably has proven difficult.  While various charging techniques, including wireless charging and faster charging, have helped make regular topping up more convenient, creating a battery that lasts longer between charges is still the ultimate goal.',0
'ELLEN PAO ON SEXISM: 'WE HAVE MADE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS' Ellen Pao is making good on her promise to continue fighting against gender discrimination.  Pao -- who lost her sexism battle with former employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers -- penned an article about the state of sexism in the latest Lenny newsletter.  Pao most recently served as interim CEO at Reddit.  She said while at Kleiner Perkins, she witnessed a host of "inconsistencies" in talk and action. She says women were characterized as aggressive instead of strong and were passed up for promotions while lesser qualified men were promoted.  "I've seen the same issues over the past 17 years," she wrote. "But we have really made some meaningful progress."  That's because it is becoming is much harder to get away with bad behavior.  "Someone is there with a camera or tweet to post it online, where it will live on forever," she wrote.  For evidence of this, look no further than former Twitter employee Leslie Miley's article last week. Just two days after Miley criticized Twitter's (TWTR, Tech30) gaping blind spots when it comes to diversity, Twitter's senior vice president apologized and vowed to make "faster progress."  Pao, who earned a JD and MBA from Harvard, said blaming a "pipeline problem" is too easy.  "Actually, it's about how the system treats people before and after they enter tech," said Pao. "When people use dog whistles like 'the pipeline problem,' they are saying: We haven't done anything wrong, and we don't care to fix it."  Pao tells women to stay resilient -- and to speak up.  "Hold the good stuff tight and close to your heart, and let the negative slide off like you're Teflon."  Lenny is a newsletter that actress Lena Dunham and her production partner Jenni Konner launched in July. It addresses everything from feminism to politics to fashion.

'WOMEN DON'T NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IDIOTS Shutterstock  If I hear once more that the reason for the wage gap is that women don't negotiate, I may just blow a gasket.  Linda Babcock herself, the author of the studies that gave rise to the "women don't ask" industry, has shown that women don't negotiate for a very simple reason: they sense -- correctly -- that it will hurt them if they do.  Babcock and her colleagues found that women don't negotiate their initial salaries as much as men. No doubt you've heard that. This finding has received a wild amount of coverage in the press.  What you probably haven't heard is what happens when women do negotiate. Often, they end up worse off than if they'd kept their mouths shut.  A 2006 study Babcock did with Hannah Riley Bowles and Lei Lai helped explain why women are less likely to negotiate their starting salaries (referred to as the Bowles study). When they do, both men and women are less likely to want to work with or hire them. The effect size is large. Women who negotiated faced a penalty 5.5 times that faced by men.  Women who negotiate often trigger backlash for gender deviance. Women are supposed to be nice and not overly-demanding. Women who negotiate flout these mandates. The Bowles study found that women's tone didn't matter much. Whether women asked simply or assertively mattered very little. A recent New York Times article advising women to simply smile when they negotiate is highly misleading, unless I am overlooking something. (I hope I am; let me know.)  In "How to Attack the Gender Wage Gap? Speak Up," we hear yet again from the newspaper of record. The WAGE program discussed in the article is a good idea, as long as its trainings take into account the complexity of teaching women how to negotiate without triggering backlash.  But it's complicated. If women act too feminine and don't ask, they end up with lower salaries. If they act too masculine and ask, then people don't want to work with them. Women walk a tightrope between being too feminine and too masculine. Men don't, which is one reason why office politics are trickier for women than for men.  This is one of the central points of The New Girls' Network and my book, What Works for Women at Work (forthcoming 2014), co-written with my daughter, Rachel Dempsey. We document the everyday ways the Tightrope plays out in women's lives and provide proven strategies for navigating offices still shaped by subtle gender bias. For the Tightrope, the solution is to mix the masculine and the feminine. But that's not as easy as it sounds. Remember that women who did not ask assertively still got penalized.  Women don't negotiate because they're not idiots. They sense a startlingly traditionalist substrata: that men are entitled to be "hard-driving," but women are not. A "successful man" is one with a big salary. It's unseemly for women to want a "big one," too.  Organizations need to take responsibility here, rather than continuing to tell women they have only themselves to blame.  The key problem here, never discussed, is with the business processes that artificially advantage men. If your organization relies on incoming employees to negotiate for themselves, men will be able to negotiate without holding back for fear of alienating people but women will not.  The solution is a new system for setting starting salaries. Some universities fix the problem by having the department chair negotiate start-up packages for all incoming professors. This solves the problem of having women scientists fall behind the men because the men can negotiate for fully-equipped labs and the women find they can't.  Another approach is suggested by a study by Hannah Riley Bowles, Linda Babcock and Kathleen L. McGinn. This study found that women do better in situations with "low structural ambiguity": where there is more information and lower uncertainty about the potential salary range and appropriate norms for negotiation. What if everyone -- both the candidates and those hiring them -- were told that incoming candidates are supposed to negotiate their salaries, along with a brief reference to the research on biases sometimes triggered when women do negotiate?  The point is that redesigned business processes to control for implicit bias are rarely discussed. What we have today are implicit bias trainings that have limited effectiveness, according to studies by Frank Dobbin and others.  Here's a proposal. What if we link every program designed to fix women with a program redesigning basic business processes to stop artificially advantaging men? Food for thought.',1
'WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS LEAD THE WAY WITH SAFER PRODUCTS Elisa Cuan immigrated to the United States from Peru at the age of 16. After battling allergies for many years, she set out to learn more about the science behind air quality and allergens. She vowed to help prevent others from suffering the way she had.  Meanwhile, Mary Anne Auer, a registered nurse, saw first-hand that cleaning measures are essential to protecting medical staff and patients. She wanted to make sure that the products being used to keep people healthy weren't also causing damage.  Today, both women are CEOs. And they both run companies that carry products with EPA's Safer Choice label.  Last Friday, I sat down with Elisa from Joseli LLC, Mary Anne from Wexford Labs, Inc. and other women CEOs and senior managers from Earth Friendly Products, Grignard Company LLC, Case Medical, Sun Products, Jelmar LLC, Osprey Biotechnics, and State Industrial Products.  All of these companies voluntarily participate in EPA's Safer Choice Program. And all of them are run by women. In fact, women-owned and women-run businesses were incredibly well represented at this year's Safer Choice Partner of the Year awards, which recognizes achievements in the design, manufacture, and promotion of Safer Choice products into the marketplace.  During Friday's discussion, I heard from many of this year's awardees about opportunities for innovation, barriers to progress, and ways that women-owned businesses can play a leading role in the shift toward safer products.  Safer Choice is about empowering parents and families to choose household products that use safer ingredients. Whether it's kitchen and bath cleaners, carpet cleaners, or laundry detergents -- when consumers see the Safer Choice label, they can feel good about the products being used around their kids, grandkids, and pets.  That's because Safer Choice products are backed by rigorous EPA science. Our experts use a stringent set of health and environmental safety standards to review products for the program. So when consumers see the label, they know it's a credible stamp they can trust.  After meeting Mary Anne and Elisa and other women leaders on Friday, it was crystal clear that these women aren't just health-conscious, they're also business-savvy.  They know that safer products aren't just healthier for people, and better for the environment, they're also profitable. They recognize that using safer chemicals creates competition. It promotes consumer choice. It brings newer, better products to market that people want to buy.  Innovation in safer products presents an incredible business opportunity, and the CEOs I met with on Friday are seizing it. They are some of the best and brightest minds in product innovation -- and they also happen to be fearless females.  At Wexford Labs, Mary Anne leads the development of disinfectants and antimicrobials that can keep people healthy and safe at the same time. Two of Wexford Labs products are Safer Choice certified.  At Joseli LLC, Elisa helped develop and introduce a dust-control product to the global marketplace that is Safer-Choice certified. All of the green technology solutions developed by her company are 100% biodegradable.  Elisa and Mary Anne are just two examples of a trend toward the use of products that are health- and Earth-friendly. Today, more than 2,000 products qualify to carry the Safer Choice label. And the list is growing.  Coincidence or not, many of those leading the way are women.  I've been in the business of protecting public health and the environment for more than three decades. Today, many more women have visible leadership roles in this arena -- whether it's in government, academia, or the private sector. But we have a long way to go.  Friday's conversation left me more optimistic than ever. And I can't wait to see what comes next.',1
'PEYTON MANNING BENCHED AFTER BREAKING NFL PASSING YARDS RECORD ASSOCIATED PRESS  Nov 15 (Reuters) - Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning's record-breaking day ended in ignominy on Sunday watching from the sidelines as his side were beaten 29-13 by the Kansas City Chiefs. Manning had become the National Football League's all-time passing yards leader early in the game, then was benched as he produced one of the worst performances of his Hall of Fame career.  Justin Edmonds via Getty Images  The 39-year-old completed just 5-of-20 passes for 35 yards and four interceptions and coach Gary Kubiak said after the game that he probably should not have started his veteran quarterback. "He came in Saturday and his ribs were bothering him a little bit. I probably should have made the decision not to play him in the game," Kubiak told reporters. "I'm disappointed in myself." Manning, who started the game three yards shy of the all-time mark of 71,838 yards, broke the record after completing a four-yard pass to Ronnie Hillman in the first quarter.  The game was briefly stopped to recognize the achievement and the Broncos also showed a video tribute to the quarterback, who acknowledged the ovation from the home crowd and tossed the Hall of Fame-bound ball to the Denver sideline. But the celebration was short-lived as Manning produced wobbly inaccurate throws and the Broncos (7-2) lost their second successive game. Manning has just nine touchdowns and a league-high 17 interceptions this season, a far cry from the numbers he has racked up as one of the game's best quarterbacks. He and Brett Favre, who retired following the NFL's 2010 season, are the only two quarterbacks to have thrown for more than 70,000 yards.',0
'CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY OFFERS $500,000 IN SCHOLARSHIPS TO WOMEN IN TECH ADVERTISEMENT  For a company geared toward “horrible” people, Cards Against Humanity sure does do some pretty meaningful things.  Earlier this year, the popular party game announced it would be selling a science-centric 30-card expansion pack to raise money toward its Science Ambassador Scholarship fund, which will provide full-ride, four-year scholarships to women pursuing undergraduate degrees in STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering or math.  The pack, co-authored by "Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal" creator Zach Weinersmith and Bad Astronomy author Phil Plait, has been a hit, drumming up over $500,000 in sales so far and the company is now accepting video applications from those interested in the scholarship for the 2016-2017 academic year.  According to the scholarship’s website, applications will be evaluated by a board of 50 women who work professionally in the fields of science and engineering.  Cards Against Humanity has made previous forays into philanthropy: In 2013, it donated more than $100,000 from the sales of its holiday pack to needy classrooms through DonorsChoose. Last year, it donated $250,000 to the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for open government.',1
'THIS IS WHAT TECH'S GENDER GAP LOOKS LIKE Not too long ago, a friend and I had a conversation about the pros and cons of single-sex higher ed institutions. Having attended a co-ed university, I staunchly defended the benefits of rubbing shoulders with men in those formative years, because well, that's what reality looks like. So why be sheltered from learning how to navigate those spaces for four years?  My friend, a Seven Sisters graduate and firm believer in the profound impact of single-sex education, eventually struck a chord. Imagine, she says, a world where STEM classrooms have a female majority. A world where no woman feels intimidated or discouraged from excelling in computer science, engineering, math, or physics. Where women speak up, lead, and challenge each other in the sciences. Where professors could not unconsciously expect men to have the answers, and where there were only women to mentor. A classroom, where even unconscious gender bias could not take place.  And, I had to admit. That concept was so far-removed from anything I had experienced that it hadn't even occurred to me. Female-dominated spaces existed but were hard to come by. And eventually, when I transitioned from the nonprofit sector to the tech world, those gaps were accentuated. From offices to conferences, meetings, and gatherings, women were a rare sight.  More Women in Tech Companies, Less Women in Tech Roles  There have been significant strides made lately to highlight and help close the gender gap in tech. From movements like Lean in or groups like Women in Tech, emphasis has been placed on creating women's spaces and mentorship for women in tech. Simultaneously, there has been a growing movement to encourage young girls to pursue interests in the sciences.  And while we've seen more women join the ranks of tech companies, the number of women in actual tech roles is still lacking. More women in the overall workforce doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with more female tech employees. A company like Yelp, for instance, boasts an impressive 50 percent of female workforce -- one of the highest ratios officially reported by a tech company. What that percentage doesn't show though, is that only 1 in every 10 tech employee is a woman, which then leaves Yelp as one of the least gender-balanced major tech company.  This trend follows other major tech companies, which have less female techies than their overall diversity statistics would suggest. At Google, they comprise 18 percent of the company's tech employees. Facebook's ratio drops to 16 percent. And Twitter sits at a lowly 10 percent.  Data from women-in-software.silk.co  One would think that more women in leadership roles in tech companies would have an impact or direct correlation with more women in tech roles. However, that hasn't been the case either. Twitter, with a 21 percent female leadership, still has 10 percent of female tech employees. Pandora, with a more favorable female leadership at 39 percent, only has 18 percent of women in the tech workforce.  A Pipeline Problem?  A typical justification for the gender gap in technology is defining it as a "pipeline problem." It's not that companies discriminate based on gender, but it's that there just aren't enough women with computer science backgrounds. And, as the numbers suggest, that may not be too far from the truth.  Indeed, what's surprising is that the number of women in the computer science field has actually decreased over time. While more women have entered higher ed over time, less and less have shown an interest in computer science. In the '80s, women in computer science programs reached 30 percent, sometimes peaking at 37 percent, while today, that number is as low as 18 percent in the US. That sharp decline is surprisingly only manifested in computer science programs and cannot be found in other academic areas.  Tackling Gendered Socialization  So, how do we tackle the gender gap in tech?  While the gender gap in tech companies is specifically visible and accounted for, it is simply a window into a wider societal phenomenon on how we raise girls in the world.  Gendered socialization begins in kindergarten and in middle school when teachers depend on boys to be logical and on girls not to be. The societal norms and concepts are constantly reinforced either at home or in schools, and steer young girls away from STEM capabilities while simultaneously encouraging them in boys. And when women push past those constraints, somehow still determined to pursue their interest despite countless subliminal messages along the way, they eventually enter the workforce, only to face the lack of female leadership and mentorship. This, unsurprisingly, leads to relatively short tenures.  If, indeed, there is a declining interest in computer science programs, which inevitably leads to narrower hiring pools, then does the answer lie in the avid push for women's spaces? As my friend argued, it isn't that female dominated spaces shelter you from the world, but it's that they allow you to develop and grow without internalizing all the gendered stereotypes and socialization that the world conditions you to.',1
'CODING SCHOOL FOR GIRLS IN AFGHANISTAN ALSO TEACHES CONFIDENCE ADVERTISEMENT  The woman behind Afghanistan’s first coding school for girls and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist took center stage Monday afternoon as astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson led a session on disruptive technology and innovation at the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting in New York City.  After alerting the audience to NASA’s announcement concerning liquid water on Mars and the previous night’s “blood” supermoon eclipse -- which “did exactly what we predicted and expected it would do,” Tyson introduced Code to Inspire founder and CEO Fereshteh Forough and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and biomedical engineer Sangeeta Bhatia.  Forough explained that, in the next month, her organization will be establishing its first programming lab aimed at women between the ages of 15 and 25. The schools will allow women to learn how to code and program in a safe place, without fear, and prepare them for future employment opportunities.  Ultimately, she hopes the schools will serve as an incubator for graduates of the program to develop mobile apps and other projects, as well as a model that could be replicated in other Middle Eastern countries.  “I think technology and education are the best way for women empowerment and helping them to step into the new world,” Forough explained to Tyson.  The schools, she added, are about much more than coding.  “It’s also about how to increase your self-esteem, to present your idea and be more outspoken. That’s why it’s only for women. It’s the only place they feel relaxed comfortable, they can enjoy and ask any question they want and be innovative.”  At MIT, Bhatia and her students are working to develop synthetic human organs, an aim Tyson called “on the face of it, a little creepy.”  These organs can serve purposes big and small -- at the “teeny, tiny” level, Bhatia explained, very small artificial livers can be used to develop more effective malaria medicine.  In addition, Bhatia touched on the gender gap in technology and science -- "only 3 percent of high-tech startups are founded by women," she pointed out out -- and noted that there are some examples to follow in making continued progress.  At Harvey Mudd College, Bhatia said, three changes were made to the school’s curriculum and over five years the school increased its participation of women in its computer science program from about 10 percent to 40 percent.',1
'RACIAL TENSIONS GROW AT UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Racial tensions are growing at the University of Kansas with a call for three top Student Senate leaders to resign and a recent graduate initiating a hunger strike.  The Senate's Student Executive Committee is demanding that Student Body President Jessie Pringle, Student Body Vice President Zach George and Chief of Staff Adam Moon step down by Wednesday and that the full Senate to take up impeachment measures if they refuse to leave, the Lawrence Journal-World (http://bit.ly/1LfUc9v ) reported. The committee registered a 6-3 "no confidence" vote Friday for the three leaders. One member abstained from the vote.  The resignation demand comes after last week's unrest at the University of Missouri and after a forum that University of Kansas Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little moderated on Wednesday, where a student group Rock Chalk Invisible Hawk presented diversity demands, which include hiring a director for the Office of Multicultural Affairs by Dec. 15, mandatory "inclusion and belonging" training for students and faculty and increased diversity in hiring.  Senate vice president Shegufta Huma, who is also member of the committee, told the newspaper that the vote was the result of months of inaction that culminated in the officers' reluctance to support the diversity demands. Pringle and George were singled out, with the committee saying they did not "stand in solidarity with their black peers and proclaim that Black Lives Matter" at Wednesday's forum.  "This is part of a larger pattern and some much bigger issues that (the) Senate has been dealing with in terms of our relationship with marginalized communities at KU," Huma said.  The three leaders released a statement Saturday, saying they plan to continue serving and professing support for minority groups. "Black lives matter. Black lives matter at the University of Kansas," they wrote.  Gray-Little, who is black, said in a message to campus Friday that her administration will begin sharing information "early next week" about how the school will move forward on the issue of racism.  Meanwhile, John Cowan, a white 2014 University of Kansas graduate, began a hunger strike on campus Friday morning in solidarity with KU student group movements. If the activist groups' demands are not met or if a plan of action is not issued by KU, "then I die or go to the hospital," Cowan told the newspaper, echoing the sentiments of a graduate student at the University of Missouri who ended his hunger strike last week after the resignations of University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe and Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin.  "I'm kind of at an advantage because of my white privilege, so my suffering is self-inflicted," said Cowan. "Others don't have that choice, it's inflicted upon them."',0
'PENTAGON TRANSFERS 5 GUANTANAMO DETAINEES TO THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were transferred to the government of the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. Defense Department said on Sunday.  The transferred detainees were identified by the Pentagon as Ali Ahmad Muhammad al-Razihi, Khalid Abd-al-Jabbar Muhammad Uthman al-Qadasi, Adil Said al-Hajj Ubayd al-Busays, Sulayman Awad Bin Uqayl al-Nahdi and Fahmi Salem Said al-Asani.  The five were described in media reports as low-level Yemeni detainees.  The Pentagon said 107 detainees remained at the Guantanamo prison for suspected foreign militants.  The Defense Department is expected soon to unveil a long-awaited plan outlining how it would close the detention center at Guantanamo despite fierce resistance to shuttering the facility in Congress.  President Barack Obama, who campaigned on a pledge to close the prison, views it as a damaging symbol of detainee abuse and detention without charge that was inherited from Republican President George W. Bush.  But the White House said last week that Obama would sign a sweeping defense policy bill passed by the U.S. Senate despite provisions making it more difficult to close the Guantanamo prison.',0
'EXXONMOBIL AND THE DISTORTION OF CLIMATE SCIENCE Last week, Mike Tokars of the Christian Science Monitor reported that:  New York state's attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and US Rep. Ted Lieu (D) of California are both looking into whether the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas company intentionally misled the public and company shareholders about its own knowledge of climate change and the inherent risks it posed to the oil industry. The outcry started in September, when InsideClimate News published an investigation asserting that, since the 1970s, ExxonMobil, has known of fossil fuels' contribution to climate change. The company's own scientists are said to have raised concerns that were contradicted by executives.  The details are slowly emerging, and sadly no one is particularly surprised that such an outrageous conspiracy might have actually taken place. What is perhaps most interesting about InsideClimate's account of Exxon's history in climate science was the company's initial role in funding the basic research of climate science and its eventual role in funding climate science denial. Exxon's corporate culture in the 1970s was future-oriented and saw science as an aid to accurate decision-making. The defensive anti-science stand came later as it became clearer that climate change threatened the fossil fuel industry's long-term future.  The role of science continues to grow in our technologically-based and complex global economy. Effective governance requires scientific literacy and effective checks and balances on the wanton disregard of the facts that science presents. When scientific paradigms shift or when new scientific discoveries are made, there may be a period of uncertainty before a scientific consensus emerges and facts become accepted. Once consensus is achieved, scientific facts become part of the reality that helps explain how the world works. If economic power is projected to distort that reality, our system of governance is placed in jeopardy. The complexity of modern life makes public voice and representation difficult enough; if scientific fact is distorted for economic or partisan gain, the public's voice is rendered meaningless. How can we render judgment and select representatives if the facts we are presented to base our vote on are distorted?  When the United States was formed we created three branches of government and a system of shared sovereignty called federalism to avoid the concentration of power in a single part of the government. It was a system designed to avoid abuse of power and ensure that governmental action required a broad consensus. We were trying to ensure that no king could impose taxation without representation. We were trying to build a representative democracy and avoid tyranny.  Today's threats to representative democracy are different, more complex, and much more difficult to counter. What protection can we fall back on when a giant, powerful, multinational corporation leads an effort to change the nature of reality itself and redefine scientific fact? The answer is of course, is the protection of other powerful institutions: research universities like the one I work for, the Congress, and, in this case, the New York State attorney general. The actions that Schneiderman is investigating began over forty years ago and the basis of his investigation is security fraud. As a publicly owned company, ExxonMobil has a responsibility to report the truth to shareholders about its operations and potential risks. A cover-up of potential risks such as climate change could well be fraud.  Here at Columbia, our climate scientists continue to work to advance our understanding of the dynamics of climate change and interact with colleagues around the world to build a consensus about what we know and what we still need to learn. In addition to research that creates new knowledge and teaching that disseminates that knowledge, we also have the obligation to speak truth to power. I worry about the power that ExxonMobil wielded in this disinformation campaign, but believe that reality has a way of manifesting itself--even if it takes decades for the truth to triumph.  We live in an information age where data, facts, theory and propaganda come at us so quickly and from so many sources that sometimes it is hard to distinguish reality from fantasy. We are desperate at times for sources of information that are worthy of our trust. That is the high ground that we need to build, seek, and protect. Peer-reviewed, global science is one of the places that we need to defend. That is why this case is so important and the deception so troubling and profound.  It also provides further evidence of government's critical role in funding science and in stimulating scientific debate and discussion. It is helpful when corporations conduct research and then provide accurate information to the public, but that is not the function of private corporations. Companies are organized to generate profit, market share and return on equity. They should not be expected to self-regulate or to invest in long-term projects with uncertain payouts. Government and mission-driven non-profits are designed for those less lucrative tasks. Corporate responsibility is a great goal, but the best way to ensure it is intelligent government regulation and effective enforcement. This is not to excuse what Exxon did to distort climate science, but the company's approach to climate science was consistent with their short-term financial interests and should not come as a surprise. Of course, they could have just shut down their research and certainly did not have to fund climate denial.  In order to prove that ExxonMobil misled its shareholders, Schneiderman will need to argue that it was fraudulent to deliberately cast doubt on the research that the company knew was quite legitimate. Publicly traded companies have a responsibility to report corporate performance and performance-related issues to shareholders. While a case such as this will be difficult to prove, if it succeeds it might have an impact on corporate disclosure of long-term risks like climate change.  Our economy and our way of life depend on complex technologies that include toxic substances which, when used without care, can damage sometimes-fragile ecosystems. We value our way of life and I see few signs of people willingly giving up their lifestyle to protect the environment. We will need to rely on human ingenuity to keep the economy growing while reducing our impact on the planet's life support systems. That will take scientific research and education, and a clear role for our institutions. The relentless ideological attack on government over the past half century has resulted in the public's expectation that nonprofits and corporations should take over governmental functions and act on the public's behalf. These other forms of organization have a critical role to play in delivering the public interest via a sophisticated public-private partnership. But such a partnership requires a strong and vibrant government.  Government represents the public and must set the rules that protect our environment and must fund and disseminate the science that helps us understand the way the world works. We've seen what happens when we rely on corporations to perform this task. We've recently seen what Volkswagen did with their knowledge of software capable of defeating air-monitoring systems. Science is not neutral, value-free, or without controversy. The role of the scientific community is to encourage debate and discussion, further inquiry, and slowly move toward a consensus. That is precisely what we've seen over the past four decades of climate research. Universities played a key role in that debate, as did international organizations and other forms of non-governmental organizations. But it was the U.S. federal government--NASA, NOAA and the NSF--that provided the funding for much of the research and model-building that was required to build that consensus. ExxonMobil and right wing ideologues have worked to destroy that consensus, but despite their determined efforts, they have failed.',0
'FEMALE CANDIDATES FACE FIERCE, UNFAIR FIGHT IN MYANMAR'S ELECTIONS In the week leading up to Myanmar’s general election, Cheery Zahau, a Chin Progressive party candidate, intends to visit 30 villages. She has been to more than 100 already, travelling predominantly on foot or by motorcycle on roads that are little more than dilapidated footpaths twined around steep, rocky hills. In village after village, she has patiently explained the electoral system to isolated voters, many of whom have little knowledge of the democratic process.  Zahau is standing in Myanmar’s poorest region, Chin state. She is currently level-pegging with an older, male candidate from Myanmar’s main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The fight is fierce; it is also unfair. While Zahau has been educating the electorate, her rival has been misleading voters, repeatedly telling them that Zahau, at 34, is too young to represent them.  Related: Myanmar: women's fight against verbal taboo symbolises wider rights battle  There have also been attempts to tarnish her reputation in the conservative Christian region by making defamatory comments to voters that Zahau – who is unmarried – fell pregnant and had an abortion. “It would not happen if I was a man,” she says.  Women hold only 6% of seats in Myanmar’s national parliament, a smaller proportion than in any other south-east Asian country. In this election, there are about 800 women standing – only 13% of the total candidate number, but more than ever before. Many of these women are, like Zahau, formidable politicians. They have had to be, to surmount the barriers obstructing women’s entry into Burmese politics.  “Our society never sees women as their leaders, except Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,” says Pyo Let Han, of the Yangon-based Women’s Political Action group, adding that the privileged daughter of the country’s idolised independence leader is an exception to whom few women can really relate.  To enter politics, Pyo Let Han explained, women need the support of their community and family, as well as self-belief. Cultural norms, reinforced by almost 50 years of rule by an all-male military junta, mean most women do not have these prerequisites.  “Chin men think that women are not supposed to be involved in activities that are based outside of the house,” says Zahau. “Women are housewives, taking care of the family. In society, most of the decisions are made by men.”  In most cases objections from the family can be surmounted, though.“Eventually, if a woman has a strong determination, then [the family] will support her,” she says, although she adds the caveat that many women are not “inspired” to reject cultural norms.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Electoral candidate Cheery Zahau sits in a teashop in Myanmar alongside her campaign poster. Photograph: Charlotte England  Pyo Let Han also sees self-perception as one of the biggest problems. “[Women] internalise that social stigma of gender inequality,” she says. “They can’t see themselves as very effective leaders.”  According to Khin Hla, director of the social rights group Yaung Chi Thit (YCT), most women’s rights organisations are trying to encourage more women to participate in parliament and at other decision making levels.  YCT runs the “she leads” initiative, which trains women in electoral and leadership skills. The programme, sponsored by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, has trained 513 women across the country, spurring six to stand as candidates in this election and several more to say they will stand in 2020. More than 70 other participants are working as polling station officers, candidate agents, and election observers.  But increased confidence does little to help women surmount the logistical issues of being bound to the home.  Shwe Shwe Sein Latt, an NLD candidate, says she rarely sees her family while campaigning. “I am lucky that they understand me,” she says.  There is also little being done by legislators to tackle the discrimination and prejudice many women encounter when they choose to participate in politics.  “There is zero law protecting woman candidates, who are frequent targets of bullies,” explains Nyo Nyo Thinn, who is standing as an independent candidate in Bahan township, Yangon. Like Zahau, who has recently had her campaign posters ripped down, Nyo Nyo Thinn says there are “dedicated teams” harassing her. “Booklets are distributed … which fabricated and falsified information about me” she says, blaming a male NLD candidate, and revealing that she is also “being blitzed by cyberbullies” on social media.  Given the discrimination women face, and the legacy of military rule, Nyo Nyo Thinn rejects the idea that women simply lack the will to enter politics. “The easy answer for some politicians and people in authority would be [to say] ‘Women are less interested in politics and less qualified’,” she says. “In fact, we have a great number of enthusiastic and well educated women in our society. But they just don’t have enough opportunities created by people in power.”  Related: Teenage girls in Burma learn to speak up for themselves and their rights | Fiona MacGregor  In tandem with the Women’s League of Burma (WLB), the Women’s League of Chinland, which Zahau co-founded, has for years been lobbying the government for an affirmative action plan. But the WLB’s Soe Soe Nwe says the authorities often discriminate against female candidates, putting their names last on lists and ballot papers.  According to Zahau, many political parties now recognise the need to recruit women. But with none of the major players making an explicit commitment to help women, in or out of politics, female candidates see it as up to them to catalyse change.  “I decided to go into national politics so I can push for more women’s cooperation and collaboration,” says Zahau, explaining that she wants to establish a women’s caucus within parliament and a women’s ministry.  “We have so many laws and bylaws to be amended,” adds the NLD candidate Susanna Hla Hla Soe, explaining that a women’s caucus would allow female politicians to collaborate on a law to help survivors of domestic violence.  But even before the election, and despite the obstacles they face, female candidates are having an impact in Myanmar.  “In the villages we have been to, a lot of women show up because they know me, they know that I am a women’s rights activist,” Zahau explains. “And a lot of high school students, they’re like: ‘I want to become like Cheery Zahau.’”',1
'XAVI ADMITS HE INITIALLY THOUGHT LOUIS VAN GAAL WAS AN ‘IDIOT’ AT BARCELONA The former Barcelona captain Xavi admits he initially thought Louis van Gaal was an “idiot” but changed his mind after a week working with him.  The former Spain international was a youngster breaking through at the Nou Camp when Van Gaal was in charge at Barça and his first impression was not favourable.  Related: Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United antagonise fans but he won’t change | Daniel Taylor  However, he soon altered his view though he admitted the 64-year-old, now at Manchester United, was “poorly valued in the media”.  “After two days of training under him I thought, ‘Who is this idiot?’ After a week, I thought, ‘He’s right.’ He’ll always be in my heart, Louis van Gaal,” Xavi, now playing for the Qatari club Al Sadd, told espnfc.com.  “[He is a] good person, very good trainer. He has a very strong character but he’s calm in the Premier League because there’s less pressure.  “He’s much calmer than when he was at Barça or Bayern Munich. He’s honest, methodical and a real perfectionist. He’s very demanding, he’s strict and he wants to achieve the highest levels possible. He’s a tough fighter, yet he put trust into me when I was 17 and 18 years old.”  Xavi also has experience of being coached by José Mourinho, who worked for Van Gaal at Barcelona, and he has nothing but praise for the Portuguese, whose methods are under growing scrutiny at Chelsea.  “He was excellent in his three years at Barça,” Xavi added. “They said he was a translator. Rubbish. He was the assistant coach, someone who understood the philosophy of Barça and who shared many of the same characteristics of Van Gaal.  “He was very respected by the players. He trained us sometimes alone at Barça B and he was excellent. I’m surprised that he became known for another type of football, more defensive, because he wasn’t like that with us.”',0
'SPECTRE STILL NO 1 IN US – BUT ANGELINA JOLIE'S BY THE SEA SINKS James Bond film Spectre remained No 1 at the US box office, with $35.4m in its second weekend, as drama By the Sea sank beneath the waves on limited release despite reuniting Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt on the big screen for the first time in a decade.  Related: Spectre stomps over Jurassic World to top 2015 UK box office so far  Spectre’s haul fell by just under 50% from its opening bow of $70m last week, and Oscar-winner Sam Mendes’ second and most likely final stint in the 007 hot seat has also passed the $500m mark worldwide after an impressive $48m debut in China this weekend. That figure is the highest of all time for a non-3D Hollywood venture.  After 10 days in cinemas, Bond’s 24th official adventure is behind 2012’s Skyfall in North America, at $130.7m compared to $161m. But the film could yet reach the heights of its predecessor, the highest-grossing movie in the long-running spy saga, if it continues to perform well outside the US. By way of contrast, the last Bond outing only earned $59m throughout its entire run in China, whose box office has grown exponentially in the past three years. Spectre also became the highest-grossing movie of 2015 in the UK last week.  Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a video review for Spectre.  The second-placed film at the US box office this weekend was once again The Peanuts Movie, which held firm with an impressive $24.2m in its second week on release. Third spot went to a new movie, comedy Love the Coopers, which stars Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Ed Helms, Diane Keaton, Anthony Mackie, Amanda Seyfried, June Squibb, Marisa Tomei, Olivia Wilde and the voice of Steve Martin in the tale of a family Christmas Eve get-together. The film, titled Christmas with the Coopers in the UK, pulled in a respectable $8.4m on debut.    Another new film, Chilean mining disaster movie The 33, landed in fifth place with an opening bow of $5.8m. Patricia Riggen’s film stars Antonio Banderas, Rodrigo Santoro, Juliette Binoche and James Brolin in the true story of the 33 miners trapped inside the San José Mine in Chile for more than two months in 2010. The top five was rounded out by enduring Ridley Scott sci-fi hit The Martian, with $6.7m in fourth for a seventh-week total of $207.4m.

'SEXISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE STARTS HERE THOMAS BARWICK  When the Food and Drug Administration approved Addyi, a prescription drug for women with low libido, this summer, it did so with a major caveat: Absolutely no drinking while taking the drug, or risk serious side effects. There was only one problem with this recommendation: The researchers who analyzed Addyi's drug-interaction side effects tested the drug, which was designed for women, on men. The drug-interaction study comprised 23 men and two women, far too small of a female sample size to assess women's risk of drinking while taking the drug. Since women are both more likely to have adverse drug reactions and to metabolize alcohol differently than men, the male results from the drug-interaction study were essentially worthless. So why didn't researchers make an effort to recruit female study participants? As it turns out, this summer's fiasco is just the tip of the iceberg. Women have been excluded or underrepresented in medical and scientific research for as long as those fields have been studied. One of the key ways women are left behind is by being excluded from or underrepresented in the clinical trials. Since clinical trial research advances our knowledge about everything from the efficacy of new drugs to which treatments work best for certain illnesses and certain groups of people, exclusion or underrepresentation in them means women are forced to accept second-class health care almost every time they receive health services. Clinical trials have a gender problem Women make up 51 percent of the United States' population, but you wouldn't know it from looking at the demographics of a typical clinical trial. Forty-eight percent of cancer deaths are among women, but women only make up 40 percent of cancer treatment and prevention trials. And good luck getting appropriate representation in studies if you're a minority woman: 80 percent of participants in cancer treatment and prevention trials are white. The disparity is especially stark in HIV research. Women make up a mere 11 percent of participants in trials for potential HIV cures, despite the fact that half of the world's HIV cases are in women.  'One extreme to the other' Historically, research and government policies were designed to protect women of childbearing age from experimental risk -- a legitimate, if paternalistic, concern. In practice, however, these policies effectively eliminated all women from trials. "We moved from one extreme to the other," said Carolyn Mazure, director of Women's Health Research at Yale and the author of an article on the history of gender disparities in biomedical research that was published last month in BMC Women's Health. The BMC article chronicles the United States' progress in including women in clinical trials over the past 20 years, starting with the landmark National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act in 1993, which required that women and minorities be included in federally funded studies. Though influential, the law did not require that women be equally included in trials, nor did it require that study results be analyzed by gender. "These are large institutions with big histories," Mazure said. "Change comes slowly." Indeed, science's rate of change in response to the gender-research gap has been downright glacial, and plagued by misinformation. Some researchers assumed -- wrongly -- that studies done on men would also apply to women, ignoring the differences between the sexes. Others believed that conditions traditionally thought to affect men, such as cardiovascular disease, didn't affect women to the same degree. In reality, more women die of cardiovascular disease each year than men, a fact that fewer than 1 out of 5 physicians were aware of as recently as 2005, according to a study published in the journal Circulation. That knowledge gap can be deadly for women. A Circulation study published in 2009 analyzed 6,000 people who called 911 reporting cardiac symptoms, and found that women had a 50 percent greater chance of being delayed in an emergency medical services setting. They also arrived at the hospital an average of 2.3 minutes behind men who reported the identical symptoms. Even female animals are excluded from research Sex-based bias isn't exclusive to human research. In animal research, female rodents are similarly excluded from study. That's important because animal studies are typically a precursor to testing in humans. If female animals (or female cells, for that matter) aren't researched from the get-go, scientists won’t take drugs or treatments that work especially well on female animals to human trial. And gender disparities in animal research are significant. A 2011 study published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews analyzed sex bias in animal research and found that male bias was evident in eight out of nine biological fields. It was especially pervasive in neuroscience, where among single-sex studies, exclusively male animals studies outnumbered exclusively female animal studies at a rate of 5.5 to 1. See the graph below for how female animals are excluded from research:  When researchers did include female animals, many didn't analyze the results by sex. Other scientists never reported the sex of the animals they were studying at all. "We couldn’t even find out if they had used males or females, because some papers didn’t even bother to say," Annaliese Beery, an assistant professor at Smith College and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post. "That, to me, is just unconscionable."  Female mice have smellier urine. An actual justification used for an all-male study.  Part of the problem is an entrenched (and inaccurate) belief that women are more variable than men, and that female rodents are more variable than male rodents, Beery explained. In other words, scientists assumed that women's menstrual and reproductive cycles and female animals' estrus cycles would make them more complicated to study. If researchers don't feel like tracking the estrus cycles of female mice, they just avoid studying them. But in 2014, researchers disproved this premise in a meta-analysis of nearly 300 studies that examined hundreds of traits and found that male and female mice were equivalently variable. "People will come up with weird explanations," said Beery, who said she has heard a variety of excuses -- from, "I just want to do things like everybody else does them," to "female mice have smellier urine" -- as to why researchers avoid studying female animals in their labs. "If you go to publish a study just on females, you always get asked, 'Why didn’t you include males?'" she said. "If you go to publish a study on males, most people wouldn’t bat an eye." The real-world effect of excluding women from health research The average life expectancy for women in the United States is 80 years, and 76 years for men. Still, that gap has narrowed in recent years, from a seven-year gap in 1985 to a 4.6-year gap in 2010 -- the result of steady life-expectancy gains for men, compared to sluggish ones for women. Among high school dropouts, the state of women's health is particularly dire. A 2012 study published in the journal Health Affairs found that despite advancements in modern medicine over the past few decades, in 2008, women who didn't finish high school died significantly earlier than female high school dropouts did in 1990 -- five years earlier, to be exact. While there's no proof that inclusion in health research would reverse these trends, women's stagnating longevity and premature deaths among female dropouts should at the very least indicate parts of the population whose health is worth studying.  Promising changes on the health research horizon In the midst of all this gender inequity, there's a bit of good news from the NIH. Following calls to action by Beery and others in the field, the agency announced last May that it would require scientists to include both males and females in preclinical research. "We now understand that sex matters in a significant way," Dr. Janine Clayton, the NIH's associate director for research on women's health, told the podcast Nature last year. The upgrade in research methods is encouraging -- but if history has taught us anything, the change will be slow. "It’s still going to be a constant issue when males and females are used in studies," Beery said. "Are the results analyzed by sex? Are there enough females included that we really learn about the females?" Mazure seems to agree. "We understand what the institutions are like," she said. "But we have to keep asking for more change, better results and for science to evolve."',1
'MANY TEEN SEX ASSAULT VICTIMS GET SUBPAR ER CARE CHICAGO (AP) -- Many sexually assaulted teens seeking emergency room care don't receive recommended tests and prevention treatments for pregnancy and venereal disease, according to a new study.  Testing and treatment rates varied widely among 38 children's hospitals studied, from zero teens treated to almost 90 percent tested.  Subpar treatment puts teens at risk for infections including HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea, along with unwanted pregnancies. The results highlight a need for better awareness of testing and treatment guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study authors said. Their report, based on 2004-13 data on almost 13,000 teens treated, was published Monday in Pediatrics. Here are some details:  ASSAULT RATES  Teen sexual assault is more common than some might think. Up to 25 percent of U.S. girls and 10 percent of boys are sexually abused or assaulted by the age of 18, the researchers said. Almost 11 percent of high school girls and 4 percent of boys reported having been raped in a 2013 government survey. Studies suggest these rates have been mostly stable in recent years.  WHAT'S RECOMMENDED?  The CDC and pediatricians recommend testing sexually assaulted teens for several venereal diseases and giving preventive antibiotics for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Other advice includes testing for hepatitis B in unvaccinated patients and for HIV and syphilis in areas where those diseases are prevalent, and providing pregnancy tests and emergency contraception.  COMPLIANCE  On average 44 percent of assaulted teens got recommended tests and about one-third got preventive treatment, according to the study, led by researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who analyzed information from a childrens' hospitals database. Rates for both varied by hospital and were lowest for younger patients.  Other studies have found low emergency room testing and treatment rates for sexually assaulted adults, for whom CDC has similar guidelines.  EXPLANATIONS  Some teens may not have been tested or treated because the assault didn't involve intercourse. Also, some hospitals might not test teens who delay seeking care, but most experts recommend doing so anyway to detect pre-existing and new infections, the researchers say. A Pediatrics editorial notes that some teens may decline testing and treatment, or may seek care in outpatient clinics, so the true rates of under-treatment are unknown.  THE ADVICE  The researchers recommend standardizing medical care for sexually assaulted teens, along with guidelines awareness. In addition, doctors need to identify and address barriers to providing these patients appropriate medical care, the editorial says.',1
'THE TERRIBLE LEGACY OF UNENFORCED TRADE LAWS Over the past several weeks, as Alcoa and Century cut aluminum production nationwide, James Markus, a 23-year-veteran aluminum worker, acutely felt the pain of those laid off.  That’s because just two years ago, in October of 2013, Markus and 750 fellow aluminum workers lost their jobs at Ormet when the Hannibal, Ohio, smelter closed. He struggled for a year to retrain and get new work and witnessed friends and acquaintances foundering. Now he’s confronted with the images of thousands more aluminum workers and their families facing those same hard times.  What makes it all worse is that it’s unnecessary. The shutdowns, production curtailments and layoffs could have been averted. The American aluminum industry needed help, which it didn’t get. The industry is desperate for relief from a flood of illegally subsidized aluminum imports from China. Many American aluminum workers like Markus would still be employed if the United States proactively enforced international trade regulations and if U.S. law permitted trade sanctions before companies and workers suffer terrible losses.  iStock image by alexsl  Markus is bitter that federal officials did not intervene to save Ormet. “Many politicians on the national level in this country have turned a deaf ear and blind eye toward working people,” he said.  Five months after Ormet closed, Alcoa shuttered its Massena East Plant in New York. But hope remained because Alcoa said it planned a $600 million modernization that would restore work there.  Seven months after that, in October of 2014, Sherwin Alumina locked 450 members of the United Steelworkers (USW) union out of its Gregory, Texas, plant. It’s now operating at a severely diminished capacity with no incentive to restore the USW workers and full production while artificially cheap Chinese aluminum overwhelms the U.S. market.  Eight months later, in July of 2015, Century said it would never reopen its Ravenswood plant in West Virginia. That meant none of the 650 workers who lost their jobs when it closed in 2009 could ever return to work there.  The following month, Century reported that it would idle its Hawesville, Ky., aluminum plant, costing 565 workers their family-supporting jobs.  Last month, Century said that by year’s end, it would cut a third of its aluminum production at its Sebree, Ky., plant, throwing 150 workers out of their jobs and that it may close its Mt. Holly, S.C., aluminum smelter, putting 600 workers on the street.  Then, early this month Alcoa announced 1,500 of its workers would lose their paychecks because it was closing or cutting production at three smelters. Two are in Washington state and the third is Massena West in New York.  In addition, Alcoa said it would permanently close the Massena East plant, dashing hopes for modernization and restoration of jobs.  This relentless cutting and closing has devastated thousands of skilled workers and their families. Markus talked about how the shuttering affected workers at his plant: “It was frustrating for many of them because they did not have a skill or trade outside of the work that they did at Ormet. That made it hard for them to find a job in our area where they could maintain the same level of income for their families.”  While these American workers suffer, China subsidizes its aluminum industry to protect its citizens from job loss. International law forbids export of government-subsidized products because their artificially low prices would warp the market in the receiving country and damage industry there. But market analysts and Century officials say that is exactly what China is doing.  Century’s president and chief executive, Michael Bless, said China is flouting international law. Its overproduction, illegal subsidies and dumping of aluminum in the U.S. market caused the collapse of the U.S. industry. Speaking specifically of the Sebree plant, he said its “continued production is now in jeopardy due to unfair Chinese trade behavior.”  The financial securities firm Nomura reported that Chinese aluminum producers benefit from opaque tax credits or cheap loans made by local governments on the condition that the companies sustain production and employment.  The American industry is not the only victim of this practice. Producers in India are complaining about China as well. Abhijit Pati, chief executive officer of Vedanta Group’s aluminum business, told the Wall Street Journal, “Due to a rise in imports from China domestic [Indian] producers are getting choked. There is tremendous subsidization of aluminum production in China.”  In a market where aluminum prices are hovering just above a six-year low, China has raised capacity, production and exports. China increased production 18 percent year-to-date and increased exports by 14.4 percent. This has contributed to the low prices. And the low prices triggered the American shutdowns.  China has seized ever-increasing portions of the global market since the turn of the century, when its production accounted for 11 percent. Now, China produces half of the world’s aluminum, and it’s not stopping. Already this year it added 3 million tons to its annual smelting capacity and may add another million tons before year’s end. While American producers close.  To block China from dumping its illegally subsidized aluminum into the U.S. market, Century and the USW are working together in the China Trade Taskforce. It is asking the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to investigate reports of misclassified Chinese aluminum exports evading U.S. import duties and illegally subsidized Chinese exports. The group is simply asking the U.S. government to enforce international trade law, which would preserve the American industry and American jobs.  Markus, who was 55 when he lost his job at Ormet, does not understand why trade officials haven’t intervened already. Too many workers, too many families have suffered.  When Monroe County, Ohio, lost Ormet, which had been its largest employer, nothing filled the void. Markus saw region’s economy fade. Small businesses on both sides of the Ohio River near the plant shut down. And, he noted, the people who had owned or worked in those shops lost their jobs too.  This is the legacy of bad trade and badly enforced trade laws.',0
'MEN SEE POWERFUL WOMEN AS THREATS TO THEIR MASCULINITY, SAYS STUDY Academic studies can be fascinating... and totally confusing. So we decided to strip away all of the scientific jargon and break them down for you.﻿  The Background﻿  As more and more women heed Sheryl Sandberg's call to lean in, it's becoming increasingly common for men to -- gasp -- report to female supervisors. This is something that's been a bit hard for men to stomach, according to previous research. But if women are just as -- if not more -- competent bosses, why do men prefer to report to other men? And why do ladybosses face so much negative bias? A recent study provides an interesting answer.  ﻿The Setup﻿  The new research comprised of three small studies exploring how men tend to react to women in power. For the first study, 76 men and women were told that they were negotiating their salaries with a new employer via messaging on a computer. Participants were split in half and told that they were either negotiating with a female hiring manager (Sarah) or a male one (David). The opening offer was $28,500, but they could choose to counteroffer up to five times. After that, participants completed an exercise to see how threatened they felt by either David or Sarah, depending on who they negotiated with.  In the end, men who negotiated with Sarah were more threatened than men who negotiated with David, and they responded by pushing back with more assertive counteroffers. For women, the gender of the hiring manager wasn't associated with their likelihood to feel threatened or counteroffer.  The second study had 68 male participants imagine they worked in a marketing department of an organization and were receiving a portion of a $10,000 bonus that would be split between them and a colleague. Participants were told they were splitting the money with either a female team member, a male team member, a female team leader or a male team leader. After reading their particular scenario, participants completed the same threat-measuring exercise from the first study. They then indicated how much of the $10,000 they thought they deserved compared to their assigned colleague.  Finally, the third study had 370 men and women follow the same instructions as the second study, but with a twist: Everyone was assigned a team leader, and that man or woman was either ambitious ("committed to climbing the corporate ladder, striving to reach the top and is tireless in [his or] her determination") or administrative ("[he or] she manages projects effectively and carries out projects that are important to the functioning and efficiency of the organization").  ﻿The Findings﻿  In all three studies, men were more threatened by a female supervisor and responded assertively. The second study showed that men paired with a female boss felt threatened and only offered her about half of the $10,000 bonus, while men paired with a male boss generally did not feel threatened and offered him a larger portion of the bonus. Meaning: A woman's power led men to be more aggressive in how much money they took for themselves.  Things got even more interesting in the third study. When female bosses were described as administrative and focused on the team -- rather than ambitious ﻿and likely to fight harder for her share of money -- men were less threatened and not as greedy in splitting up the bonus. Put together, all three studies show men feeling threatened by a woman in power and acting out by asserting themselves. According to the researchers, this pattern of behavior is common for men trying to protect their masculinity.  ﻿The Takeaway﻿  By playing with status and gender, the researchers were able to show that status alone isn't enough to make men feel threatened and assert themselves -- it's gender plus status that jeopardizes their manhood and causes them to be more pushy with women in the workplace. Clearly, this is problematic for the many talented, determined women trying to break through the glass ceiling -- or simply earn a living.  So is the fix for women to pretend they're not ambitious? To focus on the team and never themselves? No. Let these findings serve as impetus to work even harder in the face of aggression. After all, if men are truly questioning their manhood just because they're reporting to a woman, who are the weak ones here?',1
'UBER IN EGYPT TO TEACH DRIVERS HOW NOT TO SEXUALLY HARASS WOMEN Uber is teaming up with an Egyptian anti-sexual harassment initiative to train its drivers in how to “recognise, prevent and take positive action” against inappropriate behaviour, the company has announced.  All drivers available on the app will undergo the training to ensure “Uber is offering the safest ride in Cairo,” the company said in a recent statement.  The project is being launched in collaboration with Harassmap, an initiative founded in 2010 to end the “social acceptability” of sexual harassment in the country.  Related: Egypt's women-only taxi service promises protection from male drivers  The partnership with Uber is just one of many that makes up the Safe Corporates project, which aims to transform Egyptian workplaces by encouraging a zero-tolerance policy towards harassment. The project targets medium to large businesses and trains employees to take action.  Collaborating with Uber is a significant step for the campaign, since an increasing number of women have reported feeling fearful when riding in taxis.  A 2014 Harassmap study found that at least 95% of women in Egypt had been sexually harassed, most often while walking down the street in broad daylight or while taking public transport.  Uber’s Cairo general manager, Anthony Khoury, said the training will teach the definition, types and prevalence of sexual harassment, its causes and effects, as well as tips on how to react when drivers are either harassed or witness harassment. The training, according to Khoury, is particularly important for Uber’s female drivers.  “This partnership has been done as a response to the general education and training needed against sexual harassment here in Cairo,” he said. “Education is key, which is why this partnership – and the training that comes with it – is a crucial step in stopping sexual harassment.”  Harassmap’s communications manager, Alia Solaiman, explained that the initiative aims to create a role model for other companies to follow. “Creating an environment of safe corporates where a culture against sexual harassment is in place helps a lot,” she explained.  In recent months Uber has been dogged by controversy. Dozens of passengers from around the world have alleged sexual assaults by Uber drivers. Such cases have arisen in France, China and Canada. In India, a woman’s allegation that she was raped by her Uber driver sparked widespread protests and led to a ban on the service in Delhi.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver sentenced to life in prison for raping a passenger. Photograph: Saurabh Das/AP  Women in public  An amendment to the country’s penal code in 2014 criminalised sexual harassment, imposing penalties ranging from six months to five years in prison. However, many rights organisations said the reforms don’t go far enough. In a joint statement last year, rights groups slammed “an atmosphere of state impunity” that further fuels harassment and sexual violence.    Harassmap has been a pioneer in raising awareness of the issue, alongside other more recent projects including the Imprint Movement’s campaign to place comics in Cairo metro stations depicting the repercussions of sexual harassment for women.  Dalia Abdel Hamid, gender issues officer at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said creating safe spaces for women is a crucial step in combating sexual harassment. “Realising that there are corporatations and organisations that are against sexual harassment offers more protection and encouragement to women,” she said.  Related: Comic strips target sexual harassment on Cairo's metro  But it would be even better if a similar yet wider initiative could be applied to non-Uber taxi drivers, Abdel Hamid argued.    “Women who use Uber are the ones who use private transportation and who have credit cards, which is not the majority of Egyptian women. Women in public transportation and the metro are more exposed to harassment than those who ride their cars and live in compounds,” said Abdel Hamid.  “Of course, all women in Egypt face harassment on a daily basis, but the more money women have, the more protection they receive from harassment.”  Solaiman said that Harassmap has already started, as part of a safe spaces initiative, to train minibus and taxi drivers to confront sexual harassment, but on smaller scale. “Many of the targeted drivers are extremely responsive when they are aware with the roots of harassment and its effects on women,” she said.

'MICHELLE PAYNE'S MELBOURNE CUP WIN REVEALS CHAUVINISTIC SIDE OF AUSTRALIAN HORSE RACING When Michelle Payne got off her Melbourne Cup-winning horse Prince of Penzance and accused racing of being a “chauvinistic sport”, she did not exempt the owners of her mount from criticism.  “Everyone else can get stuffed [who] think women aren’t good enough,” she said moments after her win in Australia’s biggest race on Tuesday. “It’s such a chauvinistic sport, a lot of the owners wanted to kick me off.”  On Wednesday at least one of them seemed determined to prove her right.    Related: 'Get stuffed': how Michelle Payne and family beat odds to win Melbourne Cup  Sitting alongside Payne at a media conference, the six-year-old gelding’s co-owner Sandy McGregor dismissed claims of discrimination against female jockeys, saying male jockeys felt equally vulnerable.  “When you’re a jockey you’re always probably frightened that someone’s going to take you off,” McGregor said. “They’re taking the blokes off just as quickly as they’re taking the girls off. So, you know.”  Asked by Guardian Australia how it felt to hear those comments, Payne said while she was “devastated” for any jockey that got taken off a ride, there was a clear double standard.  “Probably the part that annoys me is that if you miss a start or you’re unlucky, it happens to everybody. But if it’s a girl they’re like ‘Oh, she missed a start, put one of the guys on’. If they [a man] misses a start they’re like ‘Oh, he’s just unlucky [that] he missed a start. That kind of thing just frustrates me.”  Payne also had to bat away the suggestion she had a helping hand during the race from her brother-in-law, fellow jockey Brett Prebble.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michelle Payne gives a victory salute after riding Prince Of Penzance to first place in the Melbourne Cup on 3 November. Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images  Payne told interviewer Jason Richardson she had seen Prebble, riding Bondi Beach, “manoeuvring a bit to the outside” and that “the gap just opened up, coming up to the 800”.  “To put it in context, Brett’s the brother-in-law, so he’s sort of moved out of the way for you has he?” Richardson asked.  “I don’t know about that,” Payne replied. “I don’t think he would have if he knew that was the right spot to be in.”  Despite having told reporters she couldn’t have cared less about the cup prize money, Payne was then assured by a journalist: “That Melbourne Cup makes you a pretty eligible bachelorette.    “Forming an orderly queue would be ideal for all the males,” he said.  When she got the chance to talk about the race itself, Payne, the first female jockey to win the Cup in its 155-year history, said her win came down to hyperawareness of the riders around her, plus experience, training and instinct.    “[Trainer] Darren [Weir] had drilled it into me for the last two weeks, when you get to the top of the straight you count to 10,” she said. “Do not go too early. So I just sat there. I just waited as long as I could wait, and then when I got to the point I said; ‘That’s it’. And I just let him rip.”  Payne comes from an extraordinary and stoic racing family who has endured poverty and the deaths of Payne’s mother, Mary, in a car accident, and sister Brigid from a heart attack.  On Wednesday night she will travel to Ballarat to see her father, horse trainer and supporter, Paddy Payne, for the first time since her win. Seven of her 10 siblings have also trained as jockeys. Her older brother, Stephen, was the strapper by her side on cup day who saddled the horse.  “My family is everything to me, every one of them has helped me along the way, being the baby of the family,” Payne said.  Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michelle Payne’s winning race. Link to video  “My older sisters they were trailblazers. And when I started training it made it so much easier for me to get rides, because they had paved the way.”  Payne also has nine other races to ride in the coming weeks. She will be riding for Weir in eight of them.  “It just goes to show [out of everybody who] has been supporting me ... he’s the main guy,” Payne said.  Payne had previously told reporters the Melbourne Cup may be one of her last races. She has previously suffered horrific injuries that may have ended a lesser rider’s career, including two falls in 2012 which left her with nine fractured vertebrae and unable to move.  By Wednesday, Payne was thinking differently. “I definitely thought about it [retiring],” she said.  “But I like to go with my gut instinct and go with the flow, and I’m definitely not ready to do that. I think when the time is right, I’ll know, and I’ll give it away. I hope I just can still live my life pretty similar to what it is now.”',1

'ONCE-HOMELESS VET FIGHTS BACK FROM TRAGEDY Atlanta (CNN) Pamela Burrell was a soldier cooking for U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia when she got a life-changing phone call.  "They basically just called me into the chaplain's office with another commander, higher-ranking person than myself, and explained to me I needed to call home."  Her mother gave her the devastating news: Her 4-year-old daughter had been killed.  Burrell flew back home to Birmingham, Alabama, and learned the horrendous details.  "My daughter had been hit with a fist in her liver. Her liver had been split into two," said Burrell. "She was thrown down the stairs and put into the bedroom in my apartment and left there, and she died there."  The person she had entrusted to take care of her children while she was overseas had killed her daughter.  Pamela Burrell's daughter was killed by a caretaker while Burrell was overseas.  The single mother was traumatized. "I felt guilty about what happened. I felt guilty about leaving my kids, but I was a project mom, so going into the military was supposed to make things better for my family and myself," said Burrell.  "So I buried her in three days, tried to make sure my other daughter was taken care of. Tried to make arrangements to be able to send money home to my mother for her. And I went back to Saudi to do what I had to do."  Losing hope after daughter's slaying  After being discharged from the Army, Burrell had to find a civilian job despite her grief. She became a corrections officer and, in a bizarre twist, was placed at the same prison as the person who took her daughter's life. That sent her further over the edge.  "I had an episode in the prison with the person and I knew then I couldn't continue to do this. This is going to be damaging for me. So I packed my daughter up, moved to Atlanta."  Pamela Burrell greets diners enjoying a meal from Action Ministries.  Burrell left her house and her hometown behind. She couldn't bear the reminders of her child at every turn and wanted to start a new life somewhere else.  "I had to leave, it was taking me through mental things. I had to go."  The little money she had saved up didn't go far. She couldn't hold down a job. She had mental issues that sent her into a rage or made her want to isolate herself. She was in and out of shelters. Burrell ended up living on the streets with her child and had to make a very tough decision.  "A real mother would make sure the child is comfortable. So eventually I let my daughter stay with my friends who I met here, who were fortunate to be able to move out of the shelter and make sure she had food and clothing and everything she needed."  'I didn't know if I was dead or alive'  The single mom, who graduated from Howard University with a culinary arts degree, spent more than a decade living first out of her van, in Atlanta parks, then in shelters. She worked odd jobs.  "Painting houses or doing Sheetrock or serving at a luncheon -- just doing little things to keep money flowing."  But she couldn't keep them. "It took quite a while to realize I that had a mental problem -- quite a while. I fought with it forever."  Pamela Burrell puts together meals for women and children in need.  One day, Burrell didn't feel like struggling anymore.  She took drastic measures by "putting a gun to my head, pulling the trigger. And waking up in the hospital, and didn't know if I was dead or alive."  The fact that she survived the suicide attempt gave her a new perspective.  "I take it as a sign that, OK, there's something that he needs me to do. That's why I'm still here. I haven't figured out what it is. But I'm pretty good at volunteering, so maybe that's the calling. Maybe that's what it was for."  A calling indeed. Burrell found her way to the Welcome House, a supportive housing complex in downtown Atlanta.  "She walked in and said 'OK, I'm here. How can I help?'" said Virginia Spencer, executive director of Action Ministries Atlanta.  The nonprofit, dedicated to fighting poverty and homelessness, helped get the VA benefits and therapy Burrell so desperately needed. An army psychiatrist diagnosed her with severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.  "I have been employed since then, but able to maintain that -- no. Because the holidays come and I go through it. The birthdays come and I go through my little moments."  Help for her friends  As Burrell got better through treatment and medication, she reached out to the veterans she had met on the streets.  Pamela Burrell prepares food for women and children in need.  "It hurt her heart, you could see it, with every bit of her," Spencer said. "It hurt her to find she was safe but she was leaving her friends behind."  "She has been on the streets for so long in Atlanta, that she knew a lot of them. You know, you find that a lot in the homeless community. They help each other out. They have no one but one another."  There were almost 50,000 homeless veterans on the streets or in shelters in the United States when a count was done in January 2014, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Eight percent of those homeless veterans are women. Spencer says Burrell has brought in nearly two dozen veterans to get housing through the charity.  She also helps cook meals for struggling families every week and is constantly giving a kind word and advice to people living in the same situation she once was.  Burrell says it's hard for some people to receive help.  "I used to come to this kitchen every day to get a meal. And I'm going to tell you, it really was difficult for me because I was proud. Too proud to admit I was going through a situation."  Today Burrell lives in rent-assisted housing. She's written a book about the death of her daughter and her struggle with homelessness, called "Don't Cry for Me."  Pamela Burrell wins a volunteer award for her work with the homeless.  She's received two community volunteer awards this year.  "I see myself in an apartment some day soon in the future. Would love to have my own restaurant. Right now I just want to be here. I just want to be sane, healthy, just moving along in the process," said Burrell.  "Most of us, if we went through our life falling apart, losing our home, losing our children, going through tremendous depression and hopelessness, we're not the same people," Spencer said. "What's rare about Pam is she still has something in her spirit that's loving, that's giving and that wants to help."

'SEXUAL HARASSMENT: HOW TO MAKE SCIENCE SAFER FOR WOMEN (CNN) It's a lesson most female astronomers learn at some point in their careers when they face unwanted sexual behavior from professors, advisers or anyone who holds their future in their hands.  Put your head down and don't say anything. Focus on the science.  Katey Alatalo heard it as a graduate student at University of California, Berkeley, where colleagues warned of certain professors and senior scientists you did not want to be alone with "behind closed doors."  Heather Flewelling was warned that reporting sexual harassment by a superior could work against her. After all, "these are the same people you might need a recommendation from" one day.  But when someone started stalking Flewelling at a conference, she found it impossible to ignore.  "I was terrified, and I reported it because I didn't feel safe at the conference," she said. "If I didn't get it fixed, I wouldn't go to another conference."  To help puncture the "culture of silence" in the field, Alatalo and Flewelling formed Astronomy Allies, a support group for astronomers who experience sexual harassment. Attendees who feel they are being bothered by other event participants can reach vetted allies by phone, text or email. Outside conferences, allies field queries, point out resources or simply listen when the harassed need someone to confide in.  As relative newcomers to their field with little power or influence, Alatalo and Flewelling see Astronomy Allies as an "impeachable" way for them to make an impact.  "Our job is to make astronomy feel safe for victims of harassment," Alatalo said. "Of course, we need to punish the harassers, but we're junior scientists -- we cannot punish them; we're not in a position of power to do that."  Ending sexual harassment in astro also requires 2-pronged approach. 1- stopping the perpetrator and 2- empowering the victims. Allies is #2 — Astronomy Ally (@AstronomyAllies) October 21, 2015  Turning a moment into a movement  How the field treats harassers came under scrutiny in October in a scandal involving one of its leading experts. An investigation by the University of California, Berkeley, found that renowned astronomy professor Geoff Marcy repeatedly violated campus sexual harassment policies, based on complaints from four women between 2001 and 2010.  Such investigations are conducted in secret to protect the privacy of those involved. When Buzzfeed broke the story, it was the first the university community had heard of the allegations.  The investigation focused on four complainants who accused Marcy of repeatedly engaging in inappropriate physical behavior with students, including unwanted massages, kisses and groping.  One, who studied astronomy as a graduate student, alleged she was at a post-colloquium dinner with her graduate department at the University of Hawaii when Marcy placed his hand on her leg, slid his hand up her thigh and grabbed her crotch, according to the Buzzfeed report. Marcy called the accusation false and absurd, according to investigative documents obtained by Buzzfeed.  Another complainant said she saw Marcy get "inappropriately touchy" with an undergraduate one evening during the American Astronomical Society's 2010 meeting in Washington.  In a letter to the campus community, Chancellor Nicholas B. Dirks and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Claude Steele said they did not have the authority under University of California policy to terminate Marcy without a "lengthy and uncertain" disciplinary process. Instead, they said they sought to impose sanctions that would protect students from recurring harassment from Marcy by agreeing with him on new behavioral standards.  Marcy apologized for his behavior in an open letter to the astronomy community but denied some of the allegations.  "While I do not agree with each complaint that was made, it is clear that my behavior was unwelcomed by some women. I take full responsibility and hold myself completely accountable for my actions and the impact they had. For that and to the women affected, I sincerely apologize," he wrote.  Alatalo did not experience harassment from Marcy as a Berkeley graduate student, but the news did not surprise her. Still, she braced for the "apologists" to come out in his defense.  Instead, she was shocked by the widespread outrage over the university's resolution, which some said added insult to injury. Marcy resigned days later, on October 14, from the faculty and from his position as principal investigator of the $100 million Breakthrough Listen project.  The Berkeley shakeup inspired an online petition calling on Congress to enact a national sexual misconduct policy for faculty members, citing Marcy's case as further evidence of a culture of predatory behavior that prevails on college campuses.  An open letter from Berkeley's undergraduate astronomy community accused the administration of a "lack of transparency and inadequate actions," which implied that Marcy's behavior was "tolerable on our campus."  In an open letter to The New York Times, 276 astronomers and physicists representing institutions nationwide accused the newspaper of portraying Marcy too sympathetically in an October 11 article about his apology, despite evidence he "abused his position of power, betrayed his responsibilities as an educator, and sexually harassed students."  For the co-founders of Astronomy Allies, these are all signs the scientific community might be ready to finally acknowledge a sexual harassment problem and do something about it.  "We're trying to turn this moment into a movement to improve the situation for junior scientists," Alatalo said. "We're too junior in the field to punish anybody, but we can tell people how to empower victims."  Astronomy Allies is barely one year old, but already it's earning key endorsements. Meg Urry, president of the American Astronomical Society, cited the group as a positive force in a field that seems to "lack the instinct to protect students from harassment by faculty."  The group made its debut at the 2015 American Astronomical Society conference, its members wearing red buttons to make their presence known. Participants who feel they are being bothered by others could reach allies via text, email or phone to request subtle interventions. They also offered walks home from unofficial parties, giving participants a safe out from potentially uncomfortable situations.  They received positive feedback, Alatalo said. Her favorite comment came from a senior scientist who said it was the first conference he could remember at which his students did not come to him with complaints of harassment.  People continue to reach out to the allies with concerns from their schools. There's also been talk of implementing similar support programs in astronomy departments across the country.  Harassment isn't simply a problem for women. The goal for the 2016 AAS conference is to extend the Allies' services to minorities and the LGBT community, Flewelling said.  "Different people experience harassment in different ways," she said. "We're trying to find the people who can help us to help others, not just women."  Self-preservation ahead of student safety  Harassment is not just a problem in astronomy. The hierarchical structure of both the scientific community and academia creates a power dynamic ripe for exploitation. Advisers hold sway over grant money and important data that can change a student's thesis; postdoctoral fellows rely on letters of recommendation to progress in their careers.  "The power dynamic leads junior scholars to feel afraid or unable to speak up for themselves," said Christina Richey, chairwoman of the AAS Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy. "One of the major forces in many cases of harassment is a power balance in favor of the harasser. Early career scientists are vulnerable to more senior men and women who mix professional mentoring with personal attention."  Raise your hand if you know of at least one serial harasser/bully in science who's never been publicly named or reprimanded because academia — Katie Mack (@AstroKatie) June 14, 2015  In her 30-year career, Urry has watched the culture shift to the point where relationships between faculty and students are generally frowned upon and, at some institutions, explicitly prohibited. Policies and laws that protect students and junior scientists from harassment from superiors are on the books.  But, as the Marcy case shows, "Institutions appear to be more worried about self-preservation than about their most vulnerable members," she said.  "It's understandable from a financial standpoint, frankly, but when we don't see notorious harassers being fired or suffering any adverse consequences, we are less confident that complaints will be heard and adjudicated fairly. Then there are fewer complaints and less enforcement."  Marcy's case has broad implications because of his profile as the most prominent American astronomer in his discipline of exoplanets. He has been mentioned as a possible Nobel Prize winner and has received some of the field's most prestigious awards.  "A major national STEM objective is to increase the participation of women," said David Charbonneau, a professor of astronomy at Harvard University, referring to the effort to attract more women scholars to science, math and other male-dominated fields. "When one of the most prominent scientists repeatedly commits sexual harassment, it threatens this national objective."  In response to the Marcy case, the American Astronomical Society emphasized its code of ethics, which reminds supervisors of their responsibility to provide "safe, supportive work environments" for subordinates.  In light of the Marcy case, the AAS hopes to install a new set of procedures that would guide investigations and possible "serious" sanctions against alleged offenders.  "In my view, that is what it would take to move the needle: severe and visible consequences for violating policies on harassment," Urry said. "And they do have to be visible."',1
'DECADES OF GOO MELTING OFF GUM WALL AT PIKE PLACE MARKET Story highlights The Pike Place Market gum wall cleaning is expected to be finished Thursday  An estimated 1 million pieces of chewed gum are coming off the wall  (CNN) Mounds of amalgamated goo are melting off Pike Place Market's famous gum wall in Seattle.  Three workers from Cascadian Building Maintenance started the three-day task of stripping 20 years worth of accumulated chew back down to the brick on Tuesday.  "It smells of a mixture of watermelon, spearmint and pink bubble gum," said Pike Place spokeswoman Emily Crawford. "It's reminiscent of how powerful the alley smells in the summertime, when you can smell the gum from about a block away."  It's the first time in two decades that the market's gum wall and Post Alley have received a deep cleaning. An estimated 1 million pieces of chewed gum will be removed.  Clad in rain gear, gloves and rubber boots, the workers are using industrial steam cleaners to shoot out a gallon of 260˚ water per minute. Gum and water are flowing out of the alley, where a collection system is catching gum and trash before the water flows into a storm drain.',0
