'THE SYRIAN WOMEN FIGHTING TO SAVE THEIR CITY Who would want to be a woman in Aleppo? The female population of Syria’s second city find themselves threatened both by the murderous misogynists of Islamic State (Isis) and the Russian allies of the president, Bashar al-Assad, whose bombing raids mean that now even bad weather offers the city no respite.  “Before, Assad’s forces were not able to drop their bombs when it was raining or cloudy, so those were days we were glad to see,” said Zaina Erhaim, a documentary filmmaker from Aleppo. “But now the Russians have come and they can bomb in these conditions, so there is no relief any more from the death that comes from the sky.”  Amid the carnage and suffering, Erhaim has just completed a documentary that attempts to a tell a story that was in danger of being forgotten: the story of the women who chose not to leave, but to stay and help a city to survive its darkest hour.  “It’s not just men fighting the war in Syria; it is women, too, and they feel forgotten,” she told the Observer. “The women activists are working harder, against more problems, but are forgotten as the west obsesses on Islamic State. It is just Assad against Isis, but we are still here in this ruined place and now we are facing two enemies, Isis and Assad.”  In Erhaim’s film, entitled Syria’s Rebellious Women and made over the past 18 months, she profiles some of her friends who have helped to document the war, deliver supplies to civilians and provide medical services in ways that some within their country now regard as unacceptable behaviour for women. “Our patriarchal traditions now have guns,” she says.  “Despite the insult the word implies, I’m not bothered any more by those who call me hurma, suggesting weakness, dependency, minor, his pleasure tool, his property, his possession,” she said. Erhaim is project co-ordinator and trainer with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) in Syria.  “As a trainer, I need to put in more effort to be taken seriously by my male trainees, who think ‘the hurma is training us!’ and ‘how could the hurma know better than the most ignorant man?’ They say that, as a woman, I have always to look for a man, any man, and assign him to be my guardian for the checkpoints. The armed men talk to my guardian at the checkpoint and he answers on my behalf, because as a woman I’m expected to be too fragile to talk to a stranger. This is the general rule, but I’m an exception, along with hundreds of women revolutionaries who resist all this.”  Erhaim filmed five women: Ghalia, Waed, Manar, Zein and Ahed. Manar has since pulled out of the project because she fears for her family’s safety. Waed persuaded her father to let her leave her family in a government-controlled town to move to Aleppo and work as a paramedic on the front lines. “Men went on the front lines,” she said, “and I worked on the front lines, too. Men carried weapons; I carried weapons, too. Men worked in field hospitals; I did that, too.”  Waed is angry that she has no rights over how she dresses and who she talks to. When she can she goes with her husband over the border into Turkey, where she can wear a dress and remove her headscarf.  Community activist Ghalia has faced repeated attacks and assassination attempts. Her teenage son waits every day for her by the door of their house until she returns safely. He has learned to cook and prepare food and to clean, duties that before the war Ghalia would have done as the woman of the house.  “I miss my old life,” she said. “I miss cooking and cleaning my home for my family.” Instead she has founded a series of centres that provide vocational training to local women, offering safe places for women to meet as well as learn first aid and other crucial skills in their war-torn lives. One of the centres was bombed by extremist Islamic forces.  “In 10 years’ time,” said Erhaim, “I want a young woman who looks on the internet to find out what happened in Syria to find evidence of the roles women played. This is why I have made this film and why all the women risk their lives to appear in it.”  She lives in Aleppo with her husband and says she is determined to go back when her film tour finishes in the US this week. Two of the women featured were supposed to travel with her but they were refused visas by Britain. They will join her this week in Washington.  “We are Syrian: we must be terrorists,” she said ruefully. “This is your nice country, thank you, but we don’t want to stay. It is my home, where my friends are, I have no intention of leaving,” she said.  The killing of many activists since the beginning of the revolution means she cannot let their deaths be in vain.  “You were with people on the demonstrations, chanting ‘I won’t let my country down and we’ll pay with our lives’, so they pay and you just leave? I can’t do that.”  Two of her friends are now working as paramedics in field hospitals from which the real doctors and nurses have long fled. Zein and Ahed both talk about how they cry while tending injured people. Both of them have suffered serious beatings by soldiers of Assad, by Islamic State and by men from other factions.  Zein spent 14 months in a government prison for taking part in demonstrations. “The detention centre is a cemetery for the living,” she says. At one point government soldiers raped a male prisoner in front of her. When she was released she found her home had been destroyed and her family had gone. “I only wanted the Free Syrian Army. I got FSA, the al-Nusra Front and Isis. We said Syria is for all. Everybody joined in.”  Zein has given up hope of getting married, or having a family. Erhaim, too, says that her husband gave up “nagging her” to have a baby after they both witnessed the aftermath of an airstrike on a nursery school near their flat. So many schools have been targeted that parents fear sending their children to school.  “I met one woman who sits outside the school all day while her five children are inside,” said Erhaim. “I said to her, you cannot protect them by sitting there. And she said ‘no, but if the classroom is hit then at least I will die with them’.”',1
'FGM: MOTHER AND RETIRED NURSE BOTH FOUND GUILTY OF MUTILATING TWO SISTERS A retired nurse and the mother of two young girls have each been found guilty of carrying out female genital mutilation in Australia’s first prosecution of an FGM case.  Related: Girl told to imagine she was 'a princess in a garden' as she underwent FGM in Australia  The mother and the nurse, who was referred to as KM, were both found guilty of carrying out FGM on each sister between 2009 and 2012 by a jury in the NSW supreme court on Thursday.  Another defendant, Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, a spiritual leader in the Dawoodi Bohra Shia Muslim sect, was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact by attempting to help cover up the FGM after police began investigating.  The FGM had been carried out on the sisters, now aged 10 and 12, when they were each about seven years old.  The older sister, known as C1, underwent FGM in the Wollongong home of a member of their community in a ceremony known as “khatna”. Her younger sister’s FGM was carried out in the family’s western Sydney home.  After the guilty verdict was delivered it was revealed that while the trial had been under way, the father of the girls had received an award for his commitment to the Dawoodi Bohra community.  C1 was told to imagine she was a “princess in a garden” while FGM was carried out on her by KM after her mother asked KM to perform the khatna ceremony.  The girl’s grandmother was also in the room and prayers from the Koran were read while the ceremony took place.  In each case the girl lay down on a bed naked from the waist down and was told to close her eyes while KM cut their clitorises with a silver tool. The girls suffered either type one or type four FGM with a cut or partial removal of their clitoreses which did not leave scar.  Justice Peter Johnson granted bail to all three despite the opposition of crown prosecutor Nanette Williams who wanted them held until sentencing on 5 February.  They each face seven years in jail.  Williams called detective sergeant Eugene Stek to give evidence opposing the bail saying the flight risk was too great. He also spoke about their increased standing in the community because of the trial.  The court heard all three had travelled overseas a number of times when they were on bail and had returned each time.  “She’s [KM] a senior member of the Dawoodi Bohra community and has a great network in respect to that community, there is a network of orthodox followers who fully support of FGM and the fact she has been convicted only enhances [that] they would do anything to protect her and assist her in fleeing,” he said.  Stek said Vaziri was arrested because he was planning to fly to India the same day. Vaziri’s counsel, Robert Sutherland SC, said he was travelling on a return ticket with his wife for an eye operation.  The mother, aged 38, and KM, aged 72, had each travelled overseas on bail and returned to Australia.  The mother’s parents live in Africa and she is in frequent contact with them.  “As an orthodox member of community being fully supported worldwide by members of the community, we believe strongly they will also help her flee the jurisdiction if the opportunity presents,” Stek said.  Police also stated concerns about the trio continuing to influence people to carry out FGM.  “The other concern is the continual, in my opinion, pressure they put other members of the community to keep FGM quiet, to continue the status quo and fight this until it goes away and everything will be alright,” Stek said.    Johnson said the flight risk could be mitigated and ordered all three surrender their passports with Vaziri asked to report to police six days a week.  The women will report twice a week.',1
'REPUBLICANS DEMAND US LEAD A NEW WAR TO ‘ERADICATE ISIS' AFTER PARIS ATTACKS Foreign policy hawks seized on the Paris terrorist attacks to argue for more aggressive military intervention in the Middle East, as national security issues assumed centre stage in the US presidential race.  Related: Paris attacks: seven arrested with one wanted man still on the run  Following a Democratic television debate on Saturday that was dominated by calls for a tougher response to Islamic State radicals, leading Republicans joined the fray on Sunday in a series of political interviews that also saw linked attacks on immigration and calls for more intelligence surveillance.  “This is clearly an act of war and an attack on one of our Nato allies, and we should invoke Article 5 of the Nato agreement, and bring everyone together to put together a coalition to confront this challenge,” Senator Marco Rubio said on ABC.  He was joined by his Florida rival Jeb Bush, who also demanded the US lead a new war to “eradicate Isis from the face of the earth” and warned that screening of Muslim refugees from Syria was unlikely to be fully effective in preventing terrorist infiltration of the US.  “Ultimately the best way to deal with the refugee crisis is to create safe zones inside Syria so that people don’t risk their lives and you have don’t have what will be a national security challenge both for our country and Europe,” Bush said on CNN.  “We should focus our efforts as it relates to refugees on the Christians that are being slaughtered,” he added, suggesting that specific efforts should take place to determine individuals’ religion before refugees were admitted into the US.  Republicans are increasingly less reticent than Democrats to describe the battle against Isis in religious terms. The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham went furthest of all the presidential candidates on Sunday by demanding an immediate ground invasion of Syria.  “The best thing the United States can do to protect our homeland is to go on offence, form a regional army – with the French involved if they would like to be – and go in on the ground and destroy their caliphate,” Graham said.  “We are going to fight [Isis] in their backyard or we are going to fight them in our backyard,” he added, arguing thousands of US troops would be needed in Syria and Iraq to “pull the caliphate up by the roots, take back land held by Isil and hold it until Syria repairs itself”.  Graham has long been an outlier even among hawkish Republicans, but his tone is increasingly matched by politicians in both parties as the White House struggles to articulate its compromise strategy of airstrikes and limited ground support from US special forces.  Administration officials were on the defensive on Sunday after a pre-recorded interview with Barack Obama in which the president boasted of “containing” Isis was rapidly overtaken by events in France.  “I don’t think they’re gaining strength,” said Obama in remarks to ABC that were recorded before the Paris attacks but after the Beirut and Russian aircraft bombings. “From the start our goal has been first to contain and we have contained them.”  On Sunday, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes insisted this was a “very specific point that the president was making”, rather than a broader claim of victory.  “There is no question that this is a very significant threat that is going to require a long-term campaign and there are going to be setbacks,” Rhodes said.  “We have to very methodically degrade this threat,” he added, pointing to fresh US attacks on a leading Isis figure in Libya.  Nonetheless, the slip has seen even Democrats distance themselves from Obama’s strategy for tackling Isis.  “It cannot be contained, it must be defeated,” said Hillary Clinton at the outset of Saturday’s second presidential debate.  “Our prayers are with the people of France tonight but that is not enough,” she added. “We need to have a resolve that will bring the world together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that motivates organizations like Isis, the barbaric, ruthless, violence jihadist, terrorist group.”  Related: Democratic debate: candidates face off on foreign policy in light of Paris attacks  Clinton’s rival Bernie Sanders briefly warned that the track record of US intervention in the Middle East had not helped. But even Democrats running to the former secretary of state’s left have criticised her for not being clear enough that the US has to lead action against Isis.  “I would disagree with Secretary Clinton, respectfully, on this score,” said the former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley in the debate. “This actually is America’s fight.”  Bush also echoed calls made by the US intelligence community in the last 24 hours for the Paris attacks to lead to a rethink of recent reforms designed to protect against overly intrusive surveillance.  Meanwhile, Obama met Russian president Vladimir Putin on the fringes of the G20 summit in Turkey, to discuss diplomatic progress toward ending the civil war in Syria and call for a ceasefire.',0
'AT DOC NYC, WOMEN’S (FILM) WORK Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Thom Powers, the artistic director of Doc NYC, the largest festival of documentary films in the country, said he didn’t realize what he had done until after this year’s lineup of 104 features was released. Someone else had to point out to him that his opening night, closing night and centerpiece selections were all directed or co-directed by women.          “In a way, it’s not surprising to me,” he said in an interview last week, “because I think documentary has long been an area where women directors have really flourished.”  Depressing statistics about the status of female filmmakers seem to issue almost daily from Hollywood. Only 18 percent of first-time directors of television episodes in a recent six-year span were women. The percentage of studio films directed by women hovers just below 10 percent; narrow the field to the top 100 box-office hits, and the number drops below 5 percent.  The figures improve, however, when it comes to independent film, and they nudge even higher in documentaries. Less research has been done in these areas, but a 2012 study found that 28 percent of film festival documentaries were directed by women. The figure this year at Doc NYC, which runs from this Thursday through next Thursday at the IFC Center, the SVA Theater and the Bow Tie Chelsea Cinemas, is 37.5 percent.  “Is it all good news?” Mr. Powers asked. “Is it total parity? Of course it isn’t. There’s a lot of room to go.” But the news isn’t bad, comparatively speaking, and it extends beyond directors to powerful executives like Sheila Nevins at HBO, Lisa Nishimura at Netflix, Diane Weyermann at Participant Media and Molly Thompson at A&E IndieFilms. “These are the top decision-making positions in financing documentaries,” he said.  The films Mr. Powers chose for his most high-profile slots are Barbara Kopple’s “Miss Sharon Jones!” (opening night); Amy Berg’s “Janis: Little Girl Blue” (centerpiece); and Dyllan McGee and Michael Epstein’s “Once and For All” (closing night), about the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing.  “It is kind of natural for films about performers to wind up in those higher-profile slots,” Mr. Powers said. “They make a more natural fit than documentaries that perhaps are taking you to a darker place.”  “Miss Sharon Jones!,” about the lead singer of Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, and “Janis: Little Girl Blue,” about Janis Joplin, are among a cluster of films in the festival about female performers and artists. Among the others are Ron Nyswaner’s “She’s the Best Thing in It,” about the actress Mary Louise Wilson; Craig Lowy’s “OXD: One Extraordinary Day,” about the choreographer and dancer Elizabeth Streb; and Jack Walsh’s “Feelings Are Facts: The Life of Yvonne Rainer,” about the filmmaker and choreographer, all directed by men.  Asked whether her Joplin biography would have been different, had it been directed by a man, Ms. Berg said: “I think women look at women so differently than men look at women, obviously. I feel like for this personal and intimate a story, it helped that I was a female.”  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Janis: Little Girl Blue” makes extensive use of the plaintive, earnest, witty letters Joplin wrote to her conservative parents in Port Arthur, Tex., read in voice-over by Chan Marshall, the musician known as Cat Power. “I was very sensitive to her needs and desires that she was expressing in those letters to her parents,” Ms. Berg said. “I really do understand what she was going through. I remember being a teenager, and my parents were so terrified of the music I was listening to. Just the fear of what pop culture was going to do to my brain. And I understood that she was just trying to satisfy them but also follow her path, and she was so conflicted by that.”  Ms. Berg’s film, made for PBS’s “American Masters,” is a traditional, if particularly poignant, clips-and-interviews documentary about a subject who’s not around to speak for herself (though the device of the letters gives her a dominant voice in the film). Ms. Kopple’s film is a less conventional musical biography, largely concerning Ms. Jones’s battle with cancer while trying to hold together the funk-soul band the Dap-Kings, which she has fronted for 15 years.  “The first day of filming, the first time I had even met her, was the day they decided to cut her hair,” Ms. Kopple said. “It was an incredibly emotional moment to start getting to know somebody.”  Ms. Kopple had mixed feelings about whether a female director brought anything different to a film about a female performer. “I don’t know,” she said. “I have a sense of empathy, I have a sense of connection, and an understanding, maybe, that women share with one another. But I mean the film ‘Amy,’” about the singer Amy Winehouse, “was done extraordinarily well and that was done by a man. I think it’s how you connect with your subject.”  Noting that the question was “fraught with danger,” Mr. Powers answered anyway: “There’s an intimacy with Sharon Jones that it’s hard to imagine a male director having the equivalent of. And I think both films are notable for the real compassion that the directors have for their subjects. Maybe it’s a dangerous generalization to say that a woman director brings more compassion to their filmmaking than a male director does, but I can’t help but notice that.”  Looking at “Janis” and “Miss Sharon Jones!,” Ms. Berg concluded that the question of who made the movies was not the only issue. Choosing female subjects who are complex, and less than perfect, was crucial to changing the way Hollywood perceives women, she said.  “If we start portraying stronger, more flawed women, that will bleed into the rest of Hollywood,” she said. “It’s very rare to have a conflicted, flawed lead female in a big-budget feature. Sharon Jones and Janis Joplin, these are two very strong, conflicted women.”',1
'OBAMA APPLAUDS UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI PROTESTERS IN CALL FOR STUDENT ACTIVISM President Obama has praised the protesters whose stand against racism at the University of Missouri resulted this week in the resignation of the institution’s president and the announcement that its chancellor would step down at the end of the year.  Related: Mizzou Tigers score welcome win after week of racial tension and resignations  “I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst,” the president told ABC’s host George Stephanopoulos in an interview recorded on Thursday and broadcast, in part, on Sunday morning.  Staff from nine departments joined Mizzou student protesters in calling for college president Tim Wolfe and chancellor R Bowen Loftin to resign, over a lack of responsiveness to incidents of racial prejudice on and around campus.  In a move which attracted national attention, the school’s storied football team, with the support of its coaches, said it would not play until Wolfe resigned. One student went on hunger strike. Michael Sam, the Mizzou grad who became the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, attended some protests.    After Wolfe announced his resignation, the university appointed an African American administrator, Mike Middleton, as its interim president. Tensions on campus have not entirely dissipated.  Obama has previously praised the Black Lives Matter movement, which gained strength after the death last year of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager, at the hands of a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Columbia, the state capital where Mizzou is located, is only 100 miles or so away.  Speaking to ABC in the interview, the president added: “I want an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry, and the issue is just making sure that even as these young people are getting engaged, getting involved, speaking out, that they’re also listening.    “I’d rather see them err on the side of activism than being passive.  “The civil rights movement happened because there was civil disobedience,” he said, making a historical parallel to the Mizzou protests, “because people were willing to go to jail, because there were events like Bloody Sunday.  Related: How racial justice advocates took on Mizzou and won  “But it was also because the leadership of the movement consistently stayed open to the possibility of reconciliation and sought to understand the views – even views that were appalling to them – of the other side.  “You don’t have to be fearful of somebody spouting bad ideas. Just out-argue them. Beat them. Make the case as to why they’re wrong. Win over adherents.”  Obama said he encouraged his two daughters, Malia and Sasha, to make such arguments and to stand up against injustice where they found it.  “And, you know, I tell you, I trust Malia in an argument,” the president said. “If a knucklehead on a college campus starts talking about her, I guarantee you she will give as good as she gets.”',0
'MANHUNT UNDERWAY AS INVESTIGATION OF PARIS ATTACKS WIDENS PARIS — The Paris terrorist attacks were carried out with the help of three French brothers living in Belgium, the authorities said on Sunday, as they asked for the public’s help in finding one of them.          The French authorities said they were seeking Abdeslam Salah, 26, and described him as dangerous. The police warned the public: “Do not intervene on your own, under any circumstances.” Belgian officials said that his brother Ibrahim had died in the three-hour massacre on Friday night, which killed at least 132 people, and that another brother, Mohamed, was detained on Saturday in the Molenbeek area of Brussels.  The carefully coordinated attacks on Friday night, which President François Hollande says are the work of the Islamic State, increasingly appear to have involved extensive planning by a network of men with sophisticated weapons who plotted their attack from outside the country.  The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, after meeting in Paris with his Belgian counterpart, Jan Jambon, said the attackers had “prepared abroad and had mobilized a team of participants located on Belgian territory, and who may have benefited — the investigation will tell us more — from complicity in France.”  Continue reading the main story Latest Updates  French officials initially described eight attackers, but on Saturday night said that only seven had died — six by blowing themselves up and one in a shootout with police. They said on Sunday that they were looking for an eighth man believed to have been involved in the attacks. It was not immediately clear Sunday evening whether Mr. Salah was that eighth man.  Crucial, if sparse, details about four of the attackers came into view on Sunday.  One attacker — whose nationality is not yet known — evidently posed as a Syrian migrant. The Serbian newspaper Blic published a photograph of a passport page that identified its holder as Ahmad al-Mohammad, 25, a native of Idlib, Syria. He passed through the Greek island of Leros on Oct. 3 and the Serbian border town of Presevo on Oct. 7, officials in those countries said. It was not clear whether the passport was authentic; the civil war that has sent millions of Syrians fleeing and fueled the rise of the Islamic State has also created a large black market for forged Syrian passports.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At least three other attackers were French citizens. Two had been living in the Brussels area, including one in the community of Molenbeek, according to the Belgian authorities. The third was Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, 29, a native of Courcouronnes, France, who had been living in Chartres, 60 miles southwest of Paris, and who, along with two other gunmen, killed 89 people at the Bataclan concert hall.  Continue reading the main story Video  Mr. Mostefaï was the middle of five children born to an Algerian father and a Portuguese mother, and he once worked at a bakery, according to a former neighbor at the housing development just outside Chartres where the family used to live.  “It was a normal family, just like everybody else,” said the neighbor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “He played with my children. He never spoke about religion. He was normal. He had a joie de vivre. He laughed a lot.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Mostefaï changed. “It was in 2010, that’s when he started to become radicalized,” the neighbor said. “We don’t understand what happened.”  As the authorities continued to examine Mr. Mostefaï’s motivations and background, other clues emerged from official accounts in France and Belgium.  Continue reading the main story Video  Two vehicles used in the attacks had been rented in Belgium early last week, the federal prosecutor for Brussels announced on Sunday. One of them, a gray Volkswagen Polo, was abandoned near the Bataclan after being used by the three terrorists who died there.  The other, a black Seat Leon, was found early Sunday morning in the eastern Paris suburb of Montreuil. Three Kalashnikov rifles were found inside it. The vehicle may have been used as a getaway car for the shooters at restaurants in central Paris.  The Belgian authorities also announced that they had detained seven men. Three of them passed through a roadside check in Cambrai, France, at 9:10 a.m. Saturday, while on the A2 highway heading to Belgium. They made their way to Molenbeek, where the authorities detained them for unknown reasons and seized the car on Saturday afternoon.  Fundamental questions remained: how the terrorists, who acted in three synchronized teams, managed to pull off the deadliest terrorist attack in Western Europe since 2004, and whether they received direction from Islamic State leaders in Iraq and Syria, who until now had never taken responsibility for such a large-scale attack in the West.  Continue reading the main story Video  The revelations that three of the attackers were French citizens were likely to exacerbate long-standing fears in France about the place of Muslim immigrants and converts in French society, 10 months after a smaller set of deadly attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, on a kosher grocery and against a police officer.  Mr. Mostefaï was one of three hostage-takers at the Bataclan, and was identified based on a print from his severed finger.  Mr. Mostefaï grew up around Chartres, where he lived until 2012. According to the Paris prosecutor, François Molins, he was arrested in connection with a series of low-level crimes from 2004 to 2010 and had been under surveillance since 2010, having been flagged in a French security services database as someone who had fallen under the influence of extremist Islamist beliefs. Six of his relatives have been detained for questioning; on Sunday, other relatives told French television that he had been estranged from them after a falling-out.  In his Facebook post, Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges of Chartres expressed despair and frustration. “How many deaths will occur before our political leaders understand and take action?” he asked, describing the “emotion, incomprehension and anger” he felt at the deaths.  Continue reading the main story Video  Mayor Gorges called for strong action, without asking questions first. “Our leaders don’t need to prove they are legitimate; we have elected them, so they take responsibility of the executive power of the republic,” he wrote on Facebook. “Their duty is to act effectively, and ultimately we don’t need to know how.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On Sunday, Mr. Hollande met his predecessor and political rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the Élysée Palace. Afterward, Mr. Sarkozy urged decisive action against the Islamic State — a position Mr. Hollande has also taken.

Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, is a steadfast ally of Syria’s embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, and recently began an aerial bombing campaign in Syria. The United States and France say the attacks have not been aimed at the Islamic State, as Mr. Putin claims, but at other groups opposing Mr. Assad.  Mr. Sarkozy, who has been known to be tough on immigrants during his tenure as president, cautioned against linking the refugee crisis with the terrorist attacks, but added: “We need, together, to rein in the wave of migration ensuing from the Syrian situation.”  As President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies gathered for a scheduled summit meeting in Antalya, Turkey, on the doorstep of the Syrian crisis, France’s president, François Hollande, stayed behind in Paris, his nation in mourning.  As the investigation proceeded, Mr. Obama told reporters in Turkey that the “skies have been darkened by the horrific attacks” in Paris and pledged that America would support France, its oldest ally. “We stand in solidarity with them in hunting down the perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justice,” Mr. Obama said after meeting with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the start of a 10-day trip that will also take him to the Philippines and Malaysia.  At the same summit meeting, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said there was no need for a complete review of the bloc’s refugee policy in response to the terrorist attacks.  “Those who organized, who perpetrated the attacks are the very same people who the refugees are fleeing and not the opposite,” Agence-France Presse quoted Mr. Juncker as saying. “And so there is no need for an overall review of the European policy on refugees.”  Pope Francis on Sunday deplored the terrorist attacks in Paris, which he described as an inconceivable “barbarity” and an “unspeakable affront to human dignity” that “leaves us shocked” and must be condemned.  “The path of violence and hatred does not solve the problems of humanity, and using the name of God to justify this path is blasphemy,” Francis told thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter’s Square for his weekly Angelus address.  “We wonder how the human heart can conceive and carry out such horrific events, which have shaken not only France but the whole world,” Francis said, before asking the faithful present to pray with him for the victims of the attacks.  Security measures at St. Peter’s, already significant, were increased on Sunday. The Italian government on Saturday said it would bolster surveillance of potential terrorist targets.',0
'EFFORTS TO REIN IN ARBITRATION COME UNDER WELL-FINANCED ATTACK Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A television ad during the Republican presidential debate last Tuesday depicted pale bureaucrats rubber-stamping the word “DENIED” on the files of frustrated Americans, beneath a red banner of Senator Elizabeth Warren evoking a Communist apparatchik.          The ad attacks the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created with Ms. Warren’s strong backing after the 2008 mortgage crisis. What the ad did not say: Its sponsor wants to rein in the agency in part because of its efforts to restrict arbitration — the widespread practice in corporate America of requiring customers and employees to resolve disputes not in the courts, but in private proceedings with neither judge nor jury. In fact, arbitration is one of the reasons the ad’s sponsor, American Action Network, wanted to blast the agency with the $500,000 campaign, the group said.  The consumer agency’s stance on arbitration, while difficult to convey in a TV spot, “is a perfect example of how government is taking away the power of individuals and handing it to the trial lawyers,” said Mike Shields, president of the American Action Network and a former top aide at the Republican National Committee.  Last week’s ad is one of multiple efforts across the country in recent weeks by both advocates and opponents of arbitration to revisit the much-debated practice, which, in two powerful decisions beginning in 2011, has been affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. The most significant moves came in Washington, where regulators, lawmakers and the Justice Department pushed for new restrictions on arbitration.  At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business lobby in the country, started a new effort to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by lobbying lawmakers to attach a rider to the federal budget bill that would force the regulator to conduct a new study before issuing any rule, according to people with direct knowledge of the strategy.  “If the Chamber of Commerce thinks they are going to slip a provision into a spending bill that cuts off consumer rights without a fight, they are very much mistaken,” Senator Warren said.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Matt Webb, a senior vice president of the chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform, called the bureau’s work “deeply flawed and incomplete.”  The flurry of activity follows the publication by The New York Times of a three-part series showing how corporations across the spectrum of the American economy — phone companies, credit card providers, nursing homes — use mandatory arbitration to circumvent the court system and derail legal claims alleging predatory lending, wage theft, discrimination and other violations. The reporting detailed how arbitration proceedings tend to favor businesses over individuals. In some instances, arbitration clauses require disputes to be settled in Christian arbitration, a process governed by the Bible rather than state or federal law.  Proponents of arbitration, who say it provides an efficient alternative to courts, view the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as among its biggest threats. They say a new rule proposed by the consumer agency, which would prevent financial services companies from including class-action bans in consumer contracts, could in effect kill arbitration altogether.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On Wednesday, the Justice Department issued a proposal to protect military service members from arbitration requirements. Earlier this month, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota and a longtime opponent of arbitration, renewed his push for Congress to pass a bill he introduced this year that would prevent companies from requiring employees to go to arbitration.  Several Democrats are expected to introduce bills intended to more widely curtail the use of arbitration clauses, according to the people. But with Congress deeply divided, some Democrats are calling on President Obama to use his executive authority to prevent federal contractors from including arbitration clauses in their contracts with customers and employees.  San Francisco’s city attorney, Dennis Herrera, sued American Express this month over what he claimed were “illegal and anti-competitive rules, policies and practices.” The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court, will probably help small businesses whose contracts with the credit card company prevented them from filing a class-action lawsuit.  Marina H. Norville, a spokeswoman for American Express, said, “We don’t believe the suit has merit,” adding that the company planned to “vigorously” defend itself against the lawsuit.  In Chicago, Alderman Edward M. Burke said he planned to introduce a bill this week that would prevent the city from doing business with companies that push employees and customers out of court. “It’s a way to get at a practice that is destroying a core American principle,” he said in an interview.  Arbitration has remained largely untouchable because of a pair of Supreme Court rulings in 2011 and 2013 that cleared the way for the use of class-action bans in contracts. With the current Supreme Court’s having now twice enshrined the wide use of arbitration, many opponents have pinned their hopes on the consumer agency’s proposed rule.  When the agency was created five years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal law overhauling the financial industry, it was given authority to study and craft rules to address arbitration. The agency’s research shows, among other things, that businesses have tended to get bigger awards than consumers in arbitration.  In 2010 and 2011, businesses won arbitration claims against consumers totaling $2.8 million, the findings showed, compared with awards to consumers totaling less than $400,000. The agency’s findings formed the basis for its proposed rule, which was released in draft form last month.  The Chamber of Commerce and others have said the agency’s findings do not support its proposed rules. “By ignoring its own data that clearly shows major deficiencies with court-based litigation and disregards the real-world advantages of arbitration, the C.F.P.B. has demonstrated its bias for trial lawyers over average Americans,” said Mr. Webb of the chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform.  Considerable sums of money are at stake. Late last month, the bond-rating firm Moody’s Investors Service warned that if enacted, the bureau’s proposed rule might leave companies more vulnerable to class actions that could “force changes to company practices that cut into revenues” or “draw regulatory scrutiny.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One reason arbitration advocates consider the bureau a significant threat is that it is empowered to issue rules without legislative approval, making them more difficult to defeat. Furthermore, unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is overseen by a bipartisan commission, the consumer agency has a single head appointed by the president.  At a legal summit hosted by the Chamber of Commerce late last month in Washington, participants spoke out forcefully against the consumer agency and its proposed arbitration rule. As attendees waited for one session to begin, Darth Vader’s theme song played on the sound system.  In his keynote speech on the virtues of free markets, John Stossel of the Fox Business Network lobbed a breast implant into the audience while discussing what he said was abusive litigation including lawsuits that involved claims of faulty implants. Mr. Stossel did not mention arbitration, but the subject came up during a session called Regulators Gone Rogue, in which a panelist cited the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s arbitration rule as an example of overreaching government oversight.  A chamber executive, introducing the panel, likened the chamber’s fight against regulations to the rebels’ revolt in the “Star Wars” movies. “Perhaps it is the real reason that Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie fought back against the evil empire,” he said.',0
'IN 8TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT RACE, SUPPORT FROM FEMALE VOTERS WILL BE KEY Maryland 8th Congressional District Democratic candidate Kathleen Matthews and fellow candidates took part in a forum sponsored by the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors in October. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  The words “woman” or “women” appear 11 times in the seven-paragraph biography on the campaign Web site of congressional hopeful Kathleen Matthews.  Women for Jamie, a group formed by state Sen. and fellow candidate Jamie Raskin, boasts more than 550 members, including Cecilia “Cissy” Suyat, wife of the late Thurgood Marshall, and state Senate colleagues Susan C. Lee and Karen S. Montgomery.  The seven Democratic candidates for Maryland’s 8th District seat know that women — especially those over 50 — are critical to their success in April’s primary.  More than 80 percent of Democrats in the district live in Montgomery County, where women accounted for 60 percent of Democratic primary voters in each of the past two presidential election years. The county has 17,000 “ultra Dems” — those who turned out for each of the past five Maryland primaries. Of them, 59 percent are women.  “The Democratic candidates have a choice. They can connect with women in the 50s-to-70s age groups on issues they care about. Or they can lose,” said Maryland Democratic consultant Adam Pagnucco.  He said the average age of women — and men — who voted in both the 2008 and 2012 Democratic primaries in the county was 63. Like women elsewhere in the state and across the county, they turn out at the polls in greater numbers than men. They also live longer, which extends their influence at the ballot box.  Many of these reliable female voters are retired or are winding down careers in which they confronted glass ceilings and other workplace challenges. They care about pay equity, abortion rights and paid family leave. They worry about their children or grandchildren running up debt to pay for higher education.  [Kathleen Matthews gets a spot on Emily’s List]  That’s why candidate Kumar Barve, a state delegate, mentions his work in the late 1980s as treasurer for the Maryland chapter of the abortion-rights group NARAL and his endorsement by Del. Anne R. Kaiser, a leader in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  And why former President Obama aide Will Jawando tells groups about his mother, who discovered after many years that she earned less than her male counterparts at a Silver Spring publishing company. In the White House, Jawando helped coordinate women’s and civil rights groups to support passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which strengthens protections against workplace discrimination.  On Tuesday evening, Matthews, Raskin, Barve, Jawando and the other Democratic 8th District contenders — Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez, David Anderson and Joel Rubin — will have a chance to make their case to women directly at a Bethesda forum sponsored by the Women’s Democratic Club of Montgomery County.  [Scrutiny over where money is coming from in Md. congressional race]  Bonnie Wicklund, 72, a retired librarian and ultra Dem from Chevy Chase, said she is undecided on the race and is likely to attend Tuesday’s forum. She is looking for “someone who is moderate, not an ideologue; has legislative experience; and will protect women’s health choices.” She said she wants Congress to find a way to address gun violence, although she is not optimistic that will happen.  Although Wicklund would like to see more women elected to national office, she said that won’t drive her decision. “Issues are more important to me than gender in this particular race,” she said.  Others see increasing the number of women in elected office as more of an imperative. Jane de Winter, 56, executive director of Big Learning, a nonprofit Silver Spring education program, supported former Montgomery County Council member Valerie Ervin for the congressional seat before she dropped out of the race.  De Winter said she knows little about Matthews, who had raised more money as of Sept. 30 than any other candidate. “But I feel obligated to look at her because women are underrepresented in Congress,” de Winter said.  [Valerie Ervin, citing money problems, exits 8th District race]  Some Montgomery political observers say that Matthews will benefit from the presence of two women at the top of the 2016 Democratic primary ballot: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rep. Donna Edwards, who is running for the U.S. Senate nomination against Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the 8th District incumbent.  “Hillary is going to get a lot of women out to vote in the primary, and that will accrue to Donna and Kathleen’s benefit,” said Montgomery’s former county executive, Doug Duncan.  But that scenario depends in part on whether Clinton is in a heated race for the presidential nomination by the time the April 26 primary rolls around.  There are few substantive differences among the contenders on issues that resonate with older women. More important will be the candidates’ ability to convince female voters that they can be the most effective advocates for their positions.  Matthews, 62, a former Marriott executive and news anchor for WJLA (Channel 7), will use her robust campaign account to reach women and try to show them that her story — one of juggling career and kids — is their story.  In campaign ads, she calls Democrats the party that “stands up for working women.” She touts her support for requiring employers to pay for contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act, even if they have religious objections.  Raskin, 52, mixes policy with personal stories of the women in his life, including his wife, Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin.  At the “Women for Jamie” kickoff event in late September, he paid tribute to his late mother, the feminist writer Barbara Raskin, whose best-selling novel, “Hot Flashes,” chronicled three middle-aged women taking stock of their lives after a friend’s death.  Raskin will position himself as a women’s advocate with a legislative track record that includes major roles in the passage of marriage-equality legislation and the state’s version of the Ledbetter Act.  Sol Gutierrez, 73, is the only Hispanic in the race and the only woman besides Matthews. She said she will frame her appeal around immigration, with a focus on the estimated 28,000 Latino residents in District 8, which stretches into parts of Frederick and Carroll counties to the Pennsylvania border.  “Trump has woken us up,” she said.  Sol Gutierrez said she will also be trying to reach women at the senior end of the group, some of the most reliable voters.  “There’s such a huge emphasis on youth and the millennials and the young culture,” Sol Gutierrez said. “It’s wonderful to say this is our future, but it does not focus on what the needs of our seniors are.”',1
'BOSTON IS OFFERING FREE NEGOTIATION CLASSES TO EVERY WOMAN WHO WORKS IN THE CITY   In Boston, where women make 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, an effort is underway to train every working woman to better negotiate her salary. (Pablo Iglesias for The Washington Post)  BOSTON — Eleven women huddle in an aging community center, leafing through 27-page guides on how to negotiate pay. They speak of watching YouTube tutorials, of Googling market rates, of practicing at home with partners, of vowing not to cry at the office.  They’re part of America’s largest civic experiment to close the gender wage gap, launched this fall in Boston.  Women here earn 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, 4 cents higher than the national statistic. Disparities persist across age groups, industries and companies, researchers have found — even when colleagues of the opposite sex hold identical education levels and job titles.  That’s why Boston is offering free, two-hour salary negotiation classes to every woman who works in the city. They started in October, two years after former mayor Thomas Menino pledged that Boston would become the first U.S. city to achieve pay parity.  Think of it as an intimate conversation with 170,000 women.  Economists doubt the unprecedented approach will yield much of a difference, considering the social forces that exacerbate the gap. Also, a growing body of research suggests employers may be predisposed to respond negatively to women who request more.  City officials stress that Boston’s focus on equal pay is an economic imperative. The breadwinners in most local households with children, after all, are women. And since a raft of studies has shown that women don’t negotiate less skillfully, they simply negotiate less often, the central message of the program is: Give it a shot.  Tonight’s instructor is Megan Costello, executive director of Boston’s Office of Women’s Advancement. She asks the group to role-play. Some pretend to be employees, gunning for $66,000, and the rest act as bosses, offering up to $54,000.  The employees practice their pitches: I’m worth it, and here’s why.  “I get nervous even acting these scenarios out,” says Christy Betit, a woman with long chestnut hair who works in hospitality. “I can’t even pretend to ask for a raise without wanting to throw up.”  She takes a deep breath.  “Okay,” she says, “I’ve trained hundreds of students who have gone on to get great jobs. I studied theater, and I know how to engage a room.”  Remember, Costello tells them: You have power. A company’s search for new workers takes time and money. Smart managers try to hold on to the talent they have.  “And trust me,” she says, “every man does this. Every man negotiates.”  ‘It starts with leadership’  Boston’s feminist makeover reflects a strategy from its native Harvard Business School: Experiment until something works.  A decade ago, the university acknowledged its own gender equity crisis. In 2005, Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers ignited a public relations firestorm by suggesting at an economics conference that “innate” differences between women and men may explain the dearth of elite female scientists.  By 2007, business school leaders knew they had a gender problem after a third of junior women faculty members quit in a single school year. Female students who arrived with the same test scores as their male counterparts also appeared to disproportionately fall behind in class participation grades.  So professors took action. They recorded lectures, for example, to see if male students truly spoke up more than female students, a perception reflected in the grades. They found no significant difference in speaking frequency or comment quality, concluding the men simply sounded more authoritative. Assessed for substance over style, women saw better scores. The grade gap closed in 2011.  “Heightened consciousness among the faculty and students probably made the biggest difference,” said Robin Ely, an organizational behavior professor at the Harvard Business School. “It starts with leadership. There has to be support in terms of information and resources to help organizations take a look at their culture and understand how they operate.”  Boston’s mission has good intentions, she said, but the city should carefully consider its message. “The conversation should not be around women’s deficiencies, which is inaccurate,” Ely said, “or special treatment, which creates backlash.”  Conventional wisdom, the kind that climbs bestseller lists, suggests women in pay talks should be kinder, gentler, a team player.  “But the emphasis should be on the employer,” said economist Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “Women shouldn’t have to contort themselves into pretzels and go through all these social gyrations to be taken seriously.”  Boston wants to build a successful model for other major cities to adopt, said Costello, who oversees the salary negotiation program. “Legislation alone won’t fix things,” she said. “We need to change the culture to move the needle.”  Like professors making subjective calls on class participation, how employers respond to women asking for more pay also deserves serious attention, Costello said.  She warns students that bosses may discriminate against them, consciously or not, and emphasizes that such behavior isn’t legal. A tip from Page 25 of the guide: “Employers cannot make stereotypical comments about women and their work habits or make assumptions about the work habits of women with children.” It’s just one insight from the American Association of University Women, which designed and funded the Work Smart curriculum, intended to reach 85,000 women over five years.  The program is projected to cost up to $1.5 million, not including marketing and community outreach from the mayor’s office. Its teachers — city employees and local businesswomen — volunteer their time and personal anecdotes about wrangling more vacation days or, say, maternity leave.  The city’s collaboration with the AAUW started with Katharine Lusk, policy adviser to former mayor Menino, whose friend worked on the national nonprofit’s salary negotiation workshops. They wanted to make the training available on a mass scale and measure the results.  Lusk, who authored Boston’s 2013 report on its wage gap, said Menino was inspired by the pay equality advocacy of Evelyn Murphy, the state’s first female Lt. Governor, and research emerging from Harvard and other intellectual hubs across the country.  When Menino, the city’s longest serving mayor, stepped down in 2014 and died that year of cancer, his successor inherited the work and amplified it.  “We know that the wage gap continues to be an issue all across this nation, and it’s time to stop talking about it and start taking action,” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced at an entrepreneur’s conference in April.  To that point, Costello’s team at the mayor’s office is asking employers to sign a public declaration of their commitment to end the wage gap and submit anonymized salary data, to be published in a later report.  Such actions, she said, may make more hiring managers aware of any potential biases. Academic literature on the matter is particularly grim.  In a 2005 study, Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon and co-author of “Women Don’t Ask,” famously showed people videos of men and women asking for a raise, using the same words. Among male viewers, the men’s negotiating style won approval, while the women registered as too demanding.  These judgments, Babcock wrote, probably don’t happen on purpose. In some ways, that makes them harder to fend off, which is why some scholars advise business owners to entirely ban salary negotiations.  “People will think, ‘I’m not sexist’ or ‘I’m not racist,’ ” said Hannah Bowles, a public policy professor at Harvard University, “but certain biases can creep into their perceptions.”  She found in her research on gender differences in wage negotiations that simply telling managers that this form of discrimination exists might actually reinforce that such assumptions are acceptable.  “The surprising thing is,” Bowles said, “if you just tell employers the first part of the message, they actually internalize that it’s okay to judge people for breaking gender stereotypes.”  So, she said, it’s important to also say “our company doesn’t do that.”  Boston’s lesson plans don’t encourage women to embrace stereotypical femininity in pay talks. Its success rides on one persistent finding: Women will negotiate as much as men, even harder than men, if they receive social permission to do it.  Research shows when companies remove ambiguity from wage-setting, such as establishing clear pay ranges for workers at every level, disparities between the sexes start to disappear.  Labor economists at the University of Chicago found in a 2012 study when “salary negotiable” appears on a job listing, women negotiate more than men. The opposite was true, however, when the phrase vanished.    Maria Fernandes attended a workshop on negotiation in Boston. When her next performance review comes up, she says, she will ask for a raise. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  She'd asked for a raise, once  On a recent Tuesday, class meets in south Boston’s BCYF Holland Community Center, down the hall from an indoor swimming pool. A Spider Man poster on the wall shouts: Be your own hero.  Maria Fernandes, who works to connect low-income families with affordable housing at a national nonprofit group, learned about the training on Twitter. She saw an open invitation from mayor Marty Walsh.  Fernandes writes her age (33) and race (African American) on a form.  She’d asked for a raise, once. Her former boss at a local hospital declined, blaming a tight budget. Then, she heard, he found a little extra cash for her white, male colleague.  She quickly started looking for another job.  “My mom, an immigrant, always told me to keep my head down and work hard,” Fernandes says, shifting in a red plastic chair. “She said that would be enough. I know now it’s not enough.”  Economists say negotiation accounts for just a sliver of the gap. They also point to the disproportionate number of women in low-paying jobs and the time mothers spend out of the workforce with their children. Discrimination, they note, also plays a role.  For women of color, pay disparities tend to be much wider. Fernandes, whose family hails from Cape Verde, an island off Africa’s west coast, says her heritage adds another layer of complication.  “If I act aggressively,” Fernandes says, “they’ll see me as the Angry Black Woman. And no one wants that in their organization.”  Just before her seventh birthday, her family landed in a cramped apartment in Brockton, Mass. Her mother and sole guardian worked at a shoe factory, warning her five children, “If you ever act up, they’re going to send you away.”  Fernandes, a graduate of Clark University in Worcester, Mass., carried this mentality into the workplace. The fear has influenced the way she speaks (proper English, always) and wears her hair (rarely natural; blown out and shiny — the Michelle Obama look, she calls it).  “Your experience and background would be valuable to any employer,” Costello tells her, referencing a study that shows diversity in race and gender makes companies more profitable.  The other women nod.  When Fernandes started working at the nonprofit group last year, the role came with a slightly higher salary. She’s been documenting achievements, including the company event she organized without a hitch last month in Kentucky.  Her next performance review is three months away. She plans to ask for a raise.',1
'MASTERCHEF JUDGE TELLS FEMALE CONTESTANTS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN KITCHEN AND FAMILY It doesn’t, to borrow a well-known phrase from MasterChef, get much tougher than this. Or at least that is what chef, presenter and judge of MasterChef: The Professionals, Monica Galetti, would have aspiring female chefs believe.  She appears to have done her best to dampen the enthusiasm of any young woman minded to follow in her footsteps. Ahead of the launch of the new series of The Professionals on Tuesday, she told the Radio Times that women who were really serious about a successful career in a professional kitchen should probably think about putting off any thoughts of having a family – or possibly even a boyfriend.  “At a certain point, women have to decide how much they want their career versus having a family and spending time with family,” she said. “That’s it. There’s no BS about it – the truth is you’ve got to put it first to do well. I’ve seen many amazing chefs, girls, come into the kitchen and then give it up to be with their boyfriend. Would he do that for her?”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Monica Galetti with fellow judges of Masterchef: The Professionals, Gregg Wallace, left, and Marcus Wareing. Photograph: BBC/Shine  Related: Monica Galetti: 'When I first met Michel Roux I just thought he was mean'  But is Galetti right? The evidence would seem to suggest so, given the relatively small number of high-profile female chefs. Behind the glitz and the glamour of the professional cookery shows, it seems the industry is struggling to keep pace with the times. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that, while there are 250,000 professional chefs in the UK, only about a fifth of them are female.  But Emily Watkins, for one, is having none of Galetti’s negativity. The chef-patron of the Kingham Plough, an award-winning pub-restaurant in England’s Cotswolds, was back at work last week, two days after leaving hospital following the birth of her fourth child.  “Although there are times when my husband would say that I’ve put my job before my family,” she says, “I’m happy with my career. I don’t think I could put any more into it or take any more out of it. I always wanted to be a chef and I always wanted to be a mum, but the business was my baby and I’d never missed a serving.”  Watkins feels that Galetti’s words will do nothing to encourage women into an industry that is still dominated by men.  “What she said is a little off-putting to girls because it makes you feel that your family and your career are mutually exclusive. People need to have more confidence in the industry and realise that you’re not going to be repelled for being a woman. Good chefs are very scarce. The demand for good chefs is so fierce that it’s an employee’s world.”  For Watkins it wasn’t so much a question of balancing her career and her family as of the two colliding. She went into labour with her first childwhen she was at work, and with her second and third children she worked until the day before they were born.  “With this [fourth] one I was able to have a week off before giving birth,” she says. “I’ve got a bit more of a balance now, although there have definitely been hard moments when I’ve had calls from the childminder saying one of the kids has got a runny nose and I haven’t been able to go.”  Three hours drive north-west in the more remote reaches of the Isle of Anglesey, Claire Lara, the chefwho won MasterChef: The Professionals in 2010 and now works as head of food at The Oyster Catcher, Rhosneigr, points out the irony in the fact that, while some people are quick to suggest women should be in the kitchen, there are hardly any in professional ones. Lara, one of only two women to win the series, now has two young children, and moved to Anglesey partly to enable her to have a better work-life balance for her children.  “I was pregnant doing MasterChef but I didn’t realise,” she says. “I was feeling sick and stressed out, but I just put it down to Michel Roux Jr [a former presenter and chief judge on the show].”  Lara balances family and career with the help of her mother and her husband Marc, who also works at The Oyster Catcher as a sous chef. She says that, if women chefs do decide to have children, then it is better to make as much progress with their culinary career as they can before they take a break.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rachel Humphrey, head chef of Le Gavroche, London.  “I was fairly career-driven,” she says. “I’d just made a decision to put off having children. The better the position you have in the kitchen, the more flexibility you have. The older you get and the more experience you have in the kitchen the better.”  Many chefs point to the hard, physical work and the long hours as deterrents to advancement for female chefs. Others, such as Tom Kerridge, whose Hand and Flowers pub, in Marlow, Buckinghamsire, was awarded two Michelin stars, have suggested – much more controversially – that women don’t have the necessary “fire in the belly”.  Rachel Humphrey, head chef at Le Gavroche in London, says that she did choose to put her career first, but was aware of the consequences. “I made a choice to pursue my career when I was younger,” she says, the sound of the kitchen being cleaned between servings at Le Gavroche drowning out her voice as we speak. “I’m aware it’s a sacrifice I made, I’m not unhappy with it. When people I grew up with were meeting their future husbands and getting married, I was at work. I wouldn’t moan about it, that’s my choice.”  She acknowledges the long hours are problematric, but not just for women. “I’m here all the time. I leave home at seven in the morning and get back at half past midnight. If you do this job at this level, the hours are antisocial for everybody, for the lads and the girls.”  Marianne Lumb, owner and executive chef at Marianne in west London, is sympathetic to Galetti’s viewpoint: “To be any good in the kitchen you have to dedicate your life to it. You have to eat, breathe and sleep it, especially having your own restaurant. The hours are very long and to have a relationship is very difficult because the other person always has to come second. The more successful I’ve become, the more understanding men have been of that.”  She says that now, at the age of 40, if she were to have a baby she doesn’t think it would be fair on the child. “It’s the first time in my life that I’ve started to think about it. But I don’t get down about it, because I’m sure I was put on this Earth to cook.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marianne Lumb of Marianne’s in London  FEMALE CHEFS AT THE TOP  CLARE SMYTH  Head chef at Gordon Ramsay’s flagship Royal Hospital Road restaurant, Smyth is one of only three chefs in the UK – and the only woman – to hold three Michelin stars.

'MANY SAY HIGH DEDUCTIBLES MAKE THEIR HEALTH LAW INSURANCE ALL BUT USELESS Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  WASHINGTON — Obama administration officials, urging people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, have trumpeted the low premiums available on the law’s new marketplaces.          But for many consumers, the sticker shock is coming not on the front end, when they purchase the plans, but on the back end when they get sick: sky-high deductibles that are leaving some newly insured feeling nearly as vulnerable as they were before they had coverage.  “The deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it impossible to actually go to the doctor,” said David R. Reines, 60, of Jefferson Township, N.J., a former hardware salesman with chronic knee pain. “We have insurance, but can’t afford to use it.”  In many states, more than half the plans offered for sale through HealthCare.gov, the federal online marketplace, have a deductible of $3,000 or more, a New York Times review has found. Those deductibles are causing concern among Democrats — and some Republican detractors of the health law, who once pushed high-deductible health plans in the belief that consumers would be more cost-conscious if they had more of a financial stake or skin in the game.  “We could not afford the deductible,” said Kevin Fanning, 59, who lives in North Texas, near Wichita Falls. “Basically I was paying for insurance I could not afford to use.”  He dropped his policy.  As the health care law enters its third annual open enrollment period, premiums and subsidies have been one of the administration’s main selling points.  “Most Americans will find an option that costs less than $75 a month,” President Obama said.  Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, issued a report analyzing premiums in the 38 states that use HealthCare.gov. “Eight out of 10 returning consumers will be able to buy a plan with premiums less than $100 a month after tax credits,” she said.  But in interviews, a number of consumers made it clear that premiums were only one side of the affordability equation.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “Our deductible is so high, we practically pay for all of our medical expenses out of pocket,” said Wendy Kaplan, 50, of Evanston, Ill. “So our policy is really there for emergencies only, and basic wellness appointments.”  Her family of four pays premiums of $1,200 a month for coverage with an annual deductible of $12,700.  In Miami, the median deductible, according to HealthCare.gov, is $5,000. (Half of the plans are above the median, and half below it.) In Jackson, Miss., the comparable figure is $5,500. In Chicago, the median deductible is $3,400. In Phoenix, it is $4,000; in Houston and Des Moines, $3,000.  Ms. Burwell said the administration had “seen high levels of satisfaction with the marketplace.”  And the marketplaces do vary. In Newark, some plans have no deductible, although the median deductible is $2,000, according to HealthCare.gov.  Health officials and insurance counselors cite several mitigating factors. All plans must cover preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies without a deductible or co-payment. Some plans may help pay for some items, like generic drugs or visits to a primary care doctor, before patients have met the deductible. Under the Affordable Care Act, health plans must have an overall limit on out-of-pocket costs, to protect people with serious illness against financial ruin.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In addition, people with particularly low incomes can obtain discounts known as cost-sharing reductions, which lower their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs if they choose midlevel silver plans. Consumer advocates say this assistance makes insurance a good bargain for people with annual incomes from 100 percent to 250 percent of the poverty level ($11,770 to $29,425 for an individual).  To those worried about high out-of-pocket costs, Dave Chandra, a policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, has some advice: “Everyone should come back to the marketplace and shop. You may get a better deal.”  But for many consumers, the frustration is real, as is the financial strain. In employer-sponsored health plans, deductibles have also been rising as companies shift costs to workers. Still, the average annual deductible in employer plans, $1,320 for individual coverage according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, is considerably less than the deductibles in many marketplace plans.  The Internal Revenue Service defines a high-deductible health plan as one with an annual deductible of at least $1,300 for individual coverage or $2,600 for family coverage.  Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University who supports the health law, said the rising deductibles were part of a trend that she described as the “degradation of health insurance.”  Insurers, she said, “designed plans with a hefty use of deductibles and cost-sharing in order to hold down premiums” for low- and moderate-income consumers shopping in the public marketplaces.  But the deductibles are so high they may be scaring away some consumers.  Alexis C. Phillips, 29, of Houston, is the kind of consumer federal officials would like to enroll this fall. But after reviewing the available plans, she said, she concluded: “The deductibles are ridiculously high. I will never be able to go over the deductible unless something catastrophic happened to me. I’m better off not purchasing that insurance and saving the money in case something bad happens.”  People who go without insurance next year may be subject to a penalty of $695 or about 2.5 percent of their household income, whichever is greater.  Karin Rosner, a 45-year-old commercial freelance writer who lives in the Bronx, pays about $300 a month, after a subsidy, for a silver insurance plan with a $1,750 deductible and a limit of $4,000 a year on out-of-pocket expenses.  She is extremely nearsighted and has an eye condition that puts her at risk for a detached retina, but has put off visits to a retina specialist because, she said, she would have to pay the entire cost out of pocket.  “While my premiums are affordable, the out-of-pocket expenses required to meet the deductible are not,” said Ms. Rosner, who makes about $30,000 a year.  Mr. Fanning, the North Texan, said he and his wife had a policy with a monthly premium of about $500 and an annual deductible of about $10,000 after taking account of financial assistance. Their income is about $32,000 a year.  The Fannings dropped the policy in July after he had a one-night hospital stay and she had tests for kidney problems, and the bills started to roll in.  Josie Gibb of Albuquerque pays about $400 a month in premiums, after subsidies, for a silver-level insurance plan with a deductible of $6,000. “The deductible,” she said, “is so high that I have to pay for everything all year — visits with a gynecologist, a dermatologist, all blood work, all tests. It’s really just a catastrophic policy.”  Another consumer, Anne Cornwell of Chattanooga, Tenn., said she was excited when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act because she had been uninsured for several years. She is glad that she and her husband now have insurance, because he has had tonsil cancer, heart problems and kidney stones this year.  But with a $10,000 deductible, it has still not been easy.  “When they said affordable, I thought they really meant affordable,” she said.',0
'NEW PASSPORT IN BRITAIN PUTS WOMEN IN 2ND CLASS Advertisement Continue reading the main story  LONDON — Britain’s newly designed passport was meant to celebrate the country’s creativity and innovation over the last five centuries, and officials have called it the “latest step in an evolutionary process” for passport security.          Activists and female politicians, however, say that the new travel document is a step backward because it features seven men but only two women.  The current passport, which is decorated with drawings of many birds but no humans, will be replaced next month by the new document, which the Home Office unveiled on Tuesday.  Called the “Creative United Kingdom” passport, it has been described as the most secure one that Britain has ever issued, with advanced technology using watermarks and ink that become visible only under infrared or ultraviolet light.  Stella Creasy, a Labour Party lawmaker whose successful campaign in 2013 to put Jane Austen on the 10 pound note was widely viewed as a victory for gender equality and female representation, could barely contain her disbelief.  Photo  “So tired of this shizzle — home office could only find 2 UK women 2 celebrate in 500 years of history #tellHERstory,” she wrote on Twitter.  Emily Thornberry, another lawmaker and a former attorney general in the shadow cabinet of Ed Miliband, told the BBC that the new passport was “quite exasperating.”  It is an “opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women,” she said. “We have had this fight about bank notes, and now it’s about passports. I just feel as though we are here all over again.”  Elisabeth Scott, the architect of the Royal Shakespeare Theater in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, Shakespeare’s birthplace, is on one of the passport’s 34 pages. The other woman featured is Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician considered to be one of the first computer programmers. She is known for her work with Charles Babbage, a pioneer of computer science who is also honored in the new passport.  The six others on the passport are Shakespeare; the painter John Constable; John Harrison, who invented the marine chronometer; the architect Giles Gilbert Scott; and the sculptors Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor.  James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, defended the new document, saying that images had been chosen “in homage to the successes in innovation, architecture, arts and performance.”  The new passport, he said, “is the latest step in an evolutionary process that began even before the time of Shakespeare, with a simple scroll of parchment being issued as the first passport in 1378.”  Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office, which revealed the document at Shakespeare’s Globe, a theater in London, said that it “wasn’t something where we set out to only have two women.”  He said that officials “tried to get a range of locations, a range of things around the country, and to celebrate our triumphs and icons over the years.”  “So there we are,” he added.  When pressed about why the authors Jane Austen or the Brontë sisters had not been included, Mr. Thomson said it was inevitable that some influential figures would not make the cut.  “Whenever you do these things, there is always someone who wants their favorite rock band or their local icon or something else in the book,” Mr. Thomson said.  It did not escape notice that none of the nine people honored in the new passport are from Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, although the travel document does feature landscapes from Scotland, including Edinburgh Castle.  “Let’s not lose sight of the fact that today is about launching one of the most secure documents in the world,” Mr. Thomson later told the newspaper The Independent. “So the fact that we’re also using the opportunity to celebrate creativity is really good, really nice, but fundamentally it’s about making sure this is a very secure document.”',1
'INSIDE TRUMP’S PALM BEACH CASTLE AND HIS 30-YEAR FIGHT TO WIN OVER THE LOCALS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump purchased this 128-room Palm Beach mansion in 1985 for a bargain price and turned it into a private club. But the mansion has brought Trump some controversy in the sunny Florida city. (Rosalind S. Helderman, Mary Jordan and Victoria M.

But the mansion has brought Trump some controversy in the sunny Florida city. (Rosalind S. Helderman, Mary Jordan and Victoria M. Walker/The Washington Post)  The patriarchs of this quiet island of millionaires threw up roadblocks when Donald Trump swooped in and turned its historic oceanfront Mar-a-Lago mansion into a private club.  The town council, seeing Trump as an ostentatious outsider, handed him a list of restrictions as he sought to transform the property in the 1990s. Membership, traffic, party attendance, even photography — all would be strictly limited.  But Trump undercut his adversaries with a searing attack, claiming that local officials seemed to accept the established private clubs in town that had excluded Jews and blacks while imposing tough rules on his inclusive one.  Trump’s lawyer sent every member of the town council copies of two classic movies about discrimination: “A Gentleman’s Agreement,” about a journalist who pretends to be Jewish to expose anti-Semitism, and “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” about a white couple’s reaction to their daughter bringing home a black fiance.  The move infuriated council members, who said it was a distraction from their concerns that Trump’s club would spoil a quiet street. But, in time, Trump got most of the restrictions lifted.  1 of 17 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump’s Florida estate View Photos Donald Trump has turned his Palm Beach estate Mar-a-Lago into a private club.

Trump’s relationship with Palm Beach, where he has spent three decades brawling with local officials and winning over many, was an early indicator of the personality traits and tactics that have helped propel him to the top of Republican presidential primary polls.  In buying and then winning the right to transform the landmark property, Trump demonstrated how he gains leverage by exposing and exploiting the weaknesses of his opponents, combining bombast with a willingness to compromise, and casting every outcome as a resounding Trump victory.  [Donald Trump begs Iowans not to believe Ben Carson: ‘Don’t be fools, okay?’]  The story of Trump’s ownership with Mar-a-Lago is also a reminder of the real estate mogul’s tabloid past — a time, long before he began courting conservative voters, when he reveled in extravagant parties, beautiful women and celebrity friendships.  Many in Palm Beach today recoil at his look-at-me ego and are appalled at his frequent displays of unfiltered Trump, like emblazoning his name on a coat of arms on Mar-a-Lago’s elegant facade.  “It’s all about the Trumpster,” said Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce. “I would venture to think that old Palm Beach doesn’t . . . consider him one of their own.”  The tiled patio at Mar-a-Lago, a focal point of the estate. ( Mary Jordan/The Washington Post)  But, just as Trump has forced many in the national Republican establishment to accept him as an enduring presence in this year’s presidential campaign, Trump and his club have become undeniable cornerstones of Palm Beach society.  “Whether they love me or not, everyone agrees the greatest and most important place in Palm Beach is Mar-a-Lago,” Trump boasted in a recent interview. “I took this ultimate place and made it incredible and opened it, essentially, to the people of Palm Beach. The fact that I owned it made it a lot easier to get along with the Palm Beach establishment.”  Trump, who points on the campaign trail to his lack of political experience as a plus, said voters should consider his record with Mar-a-Lago as evidence that he could be a strong commander-in-chief. His Palm Beach dealings, he said, offer a lesson on how the United States, “should be negotiating with Iran, with China, with India and with Japan and everybody else.”  The host with the most  The property today, encompassing more than 17 acres on this narrow, 16-mile-long island, operates in two money-making ways. It is a private club, open to members who pay a $100,000 initiation fee plus annual dues of $14,000, and a venue that can be rented for weddings and events. Trump brags that Mar-a-Lago hosts superior events to another iconic Palm Beach property, the century-old Breakers Hotel, which he said “gets the leftovers.”  Last year, Trump made $15.6 million from Mar-a-Lago, according to financial disclosures Trump filed as part of his presidential campaign.  Trump closes off part of the main house for his private quarters. The name of Trump’s late mother, Mary Trump, who grew up in a modest house in Scotland, appears over the door to the room where she often stayed. Another room is dominated by an elaborate canopied bed where Trump’s daughters Ivanka and Tiffany slept as children.  Many of Trump’s rivals in the presidential race have been to Mar-a-Lago for functions, including Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. So have many Republican commentators, including Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham.  Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton came, too, attending Trump’s wedding to Melania Knauss 10 years ago.  [Meet Melania Trump, a new model for first lady]  Since 2013, the Palm Beach County Republican Committee has held its annual Lincoln Day fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. Michael Barnett, committee chairman, remembers seeing Cruz last year deep in conversation with Trump and wonders if one of the reasons they are so friendly on the campaign trail is because of a bond forged at Mar-a-Lago.  Until he hit the presidential campaign trail, Trump spent many weekends at Mar-a-Lago, hopping table to table asking diners if they tried his mother’s meatloaf on the menu or enjoyed his ocean view. Trump, whose brother died of alcoholism, does not drink. Friends say his relaxation comes from golf and presiding over Mar-a-Lago, chatting with guests.  He lets Palm Beachers come to him, rarely venturing out to shops and restaurants in town.  “I do get along with people,” Trump said. “You have everybody there. You have people from the Middle East. You have Jewish people. I mean, you have Jewish people having dinner with people from the Middle East. You have Christians. You have old-line WASPs.”  The winter White House  Mar-a-Lago was opened in 1927 as a private estate by one of the richest women in the world, Marjorie Merriweather Post.  She donated her 128-room home to the U.S. government in 1973 for use as the winter White House. But under President Jimmy Carter, the government turned the property over to the private Post Foundation, saying it was too expensive to maintain.  Trump wanted it to be his.  So, according to Trump, when his first offer of $28 million was turned down, he decided to play hardball. He said he bought the beachfront property directly in front of it through a third party and threatened to put up a hideous home to block its ocean view, he recalled in the interview.  “That was my first wall,” he said. “That drove everybody nuts. They couldn’t sell the big house because I owned the beach, so the price kept going down and down.”  In the end, Trump bought the landmark in 1985 for a bargain, paying $5 million for the house and $3 million for Post’s antiques and lavish furnishings.  From the start, Trump’s approach stood out in Palm Beach, a small town whose cloistered estates and private beaches appealed to the super rich seeking to live quietly.  Along with old-money families with homes here since the Gilded Age, there are billionaires with more money than Trump who drive their Bentleys into estates hidden behind high hedges.  Trump had Mar-a-Lago’s hedge on South Ocean Drive chopped down to ensure passersby could see his castle.  He has invited high-profile guests such as Michael Jackson to stay overnight, drawing paparazzi. He was chided in local papers for floating the rumor that Princess Diana, Madonna and other big names were joining his club, a promoter’s tactic to build buzz.  Over time, he added a Louis XIV-style ballroom with 40-foot ceilings and $7 million worth of gold leaf on its walls. He spent $100,000 on four gold-plated bathroom sinks near the ballroom.  “It’s become part of the fabric of the social life of Palm Beach,” said Jane Day, who as the town’s historic preservation consultant at times clashed with Trump. But like many, she credited Trump with saving the historic home and managing it in a way that has allowed many people to enjoy it.  The property employs scores of waiters, landscapers, cooks and other staff, including foreign workers brought in using special visas. Trump’s reliance on immigrant labor has received attention in recent months as he has made illegal immigration a signature issue on the campaign trail.  An open invitation  Trump made Mar-a-Lago appealing even to his biggest skeptics. He brought in headliners including Elton John, Celine Dion, Diana Ross, Luciano Pavaratti and Jay Leno, who performed at charity balls and events open to anyone who could afford a ticket.  By opening access, Trump sought to dull opposition to him.  Trump urged officials to become members, including those he was feuding with.  For a time, McDonald, the former mayor, was even doubles partners at the club with Marla Maples, Trump’s second wife.  Trump invited the historic preservation society arguing with him over alterations to the landmark to hold its annual luncheon there. And the town police, summoned if a party grew too noisy, now hold their annual benefit there. Police records show officers often have stopped at the mansion for coffee and meal breaks.  Allen Wyett, a frequent Trump critic, recalled that the morning after Wyett’s election to the town council in 1995, he received a phone call from Trump, who wanted to personally invite him to a show at Mar-a-Lago. Wyett declined and never joined Mar-a-Lago. But he said the invitations continued to concerts, to comedy shows.  Wyett, who is Jewish, said he would hear Trump talk with pride about Mar-a-Lago’s nondiscriminatory policy, but wondered if it was a business strategy: “Was he smart enough to realize that Palm Beach is about 40 percent Jewish and he was not going to attract the old guard anyway?”  Outrageous and effective  Mar-a-Lago became a party destination in the late 1990s, particularly after Trump split from Maples and before he married Knauss. Rich men mingled with the models and beauty pageant contestants who always seemed to be floating around his tiled patio.  “It was 3-to-2, beautiful women-to-men,” recalled Roger Stone, a former adviser to Trump.  “That’s true,” Trump, laughed, stressing he was single at the time. “The point was to have fun. It was wild.”  In 1998, Trump invited Sean Combs, the rapper then known as Puff Daddy. But Combs scandalized Palm Beach when he was caught on a beach in the “middle of his midnight romp with a long-legged stunner,” according to the Page Six account in the New York Post.  Even as Mar-a-Lago became more established, Trump’s battles with local officials never really ended.  Wyett and other council members said the town’s fights with Trump typically boiled down to Palm Beach trying to apply rules designed to protect a residential neighborhood. In their view, Trump doesn’t believe rules apply to him. But they said his unconventional tactics have often worked.  “He can be outrageous.” said Wyett. “He can be as gentle as a kid. He can be gracious. He can be as vindictive as anyone you’ve ever met. He’s everything wrapped into one package with a ribbon on it.”  Flags and planes overhead  Palm Beach has a lot of rules: No whistling allowed on public streets after midnight. No “Missing Dog” — or any sign — posted on a tree. And no flag poles taller than 42 feet.  In late 2006 Trump put up a giant American flag on an 80-foot pole. That led to a $1,250-a-day fine against him, drawing national headlines that Trump basked in.  “Tonight, Donald Trump does legal battle again, this time with a bunch of millionaires down in Palm Beach, Florida, who told Trump he’s flying his flag too high,” is how Nancy Grace started her CNN interview in January 2007 with Trump. “Can you fly the American flag too high?” she asked.  Trump got fan mail as he said in a blizzard of interviews: “No American should have to get a permit to fly the flag.”  “I said, ‘This is a dream to have someone sue me to take down the American flag,’ ” Trump said in the interview.  Trump sued Palm Beach for $25 million in damages, arguing the flag was constitutionally protected free speech.  Ultimately, Trump reached a settlement with the town. He would put a slightly smaller flag farther from the road and mount it on a 70-foot pole.  Instead of paying any fines, Trump made a $100,000 donation to a veterans charity.  When he was mayor, McDonald, a military veteran, said he “got heartburn” as Trump used a little town regulation to shower himself with “$100 million in free publicity.”  While gracious to many neighbors, Trump has mocked others.  He famously called actress Dina Merrill, the daughter of Mar-a-Lago founder Marjorie Merriweather Post, “arrogant and aloof.” In his book “The Art of the Comeback,” he said she was working against his plans for the estate and that she had been “born with her mother’s beauty but not her brains.” He called a civic leader who opposed his efforts a “loser.”  He has filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits as casually as others file their nails. It’s a Trump strategy, critics say, to wear people out and get what he wants.  Trump has filed three lawsuits over perhaps his biggest irritation: the planes that fly over Mar-a-Lago, which sits just a couple miles from the West Palm Beach airport’s main runway.  A judge is now weighing a $100 million lawsuit Trump filed in January, arguing that airport director Bruce Pelly — who Trump has called “a moron” — has engaged in a “deliberate and malicious” effort to direct the planes over his home.  Pelly and a county attorney declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. In court, the county has argued that the Federal Aviation Administration traffic controllers determine airplane flight paths, not Pelly.  The suit, they argued in court, appeared designed to “create press buzz for Trump’s announced presidential campaign, cocktail party braggadocio and negotiating leverage.”  In his first lawsuit involving the airport, Trump won no money and the planes continued to fly over Mar-a-Lago. But Palm Beach County agreed to try to limit noise and said it would lease a 215-acre parcel of airport-owned land to Trump. That land is now the Trump International Golf Course West Palm, where, according to federal filings, Trump made $12.7 million last year.  “There was a lot of strategy in it. You have to admire him for it,” McDonald said.  People in town now speculate Trump might have finally found a way to clear the sky above.  If elected president and the house becomes the winter White House as the original owner intended, the Secret Service could order a no-fly zone.',0
'THE DEMISE OF WOMEN'S CHARITY EAVES SHOULD WORRY US ALL In 1987 I found myself homeless, having moved to London from Leeds, and was directed to Eaves (then known as Homeless Action), a charity set up a decade earlier that provided homes for single, low-income women. I was given a room in a terraced house in Peckham, which I shared with five other women, some of whom were homeless as a result of sexual violence. I would see the support workers come over to take care of these vulnerable women, and was impressed at how much difference it made to their daily lives.  Last week I sat at my desk in Eaves for Women, and watched the staff clear out their desks. The funding had gone and the charity had no choice but to go into administration.  Eaves will leave behind the 1,000 or so service users who access the charity every year, asking for support, advocacy, or long-term social work. Eaves was unique in that ,since it appointed the formidable Denise Marshall in 2000 as its chief executive, it combined direct support to women who had experienced a wide range of male violence and abuse, with campaigning, lobbying, research, policy, and peer-support programmes in which service users could go on to volunteer to work with other vulnerable women.  I have been a research consultant for Eaves since 2004, and was a friend of Marshall, who died in August. But even putting aside my personal ties to the organisation, it’s clear to see how this cruel and ruthless government is slashing women’s services and expecting them delivered on the cheap; increasingly, women’s charities are being given less money to see the same number of women, and are expected to cut the quality of the services. In order to be competitive when applying for local or central government grants the costs for core services, such as rent and administrative support, are often undercut to the point where it was almost impossible to run an office.  Marshall refused to put costs above quality. Having seen other women’s charities being taken over by generic organisations which then paid the staff less and provided poorer services to abused women, Marshall was having none of it. In 2011, she returned her OBE in protest at government cuts.  “As a feminist organisation, you have to deliver your services in that context in order to change things in the long term,” says Karen Ingala Smith, the director of the NIA Project and former employee of Eaves. “This government is only interested in delivering the bare minimum to women and girls because of its own massive budget cuts.”  Eaves had been in financial difficulty since 2010. In 2011, the Home Office gave Eaves a total of £4m to run two essential services – one, the Poppy Project, which houses and supports women trafficked into the UK, and the Scarlett Centre, a drop-in support centre for women that provided support to seek work or education. The following year, Eaves received nothing. The government grant to support trafficked women went to the Salvation Army, which had submitted an application for considerably less funding and a pared-down service, and Scarlett was closed for good.  We need to get back on to the streets to protest these savage cuts to the women’s sector, and make sure everyone knows that all woman can be a step away from needing the type of support Eaves provided. Are women’s lives really that worthless?',1
'US SUPREME COURT TO HEAR BIGGEST ABORTION RIGHTS CASE IN TWO DECADES The US supreme court has agreed to hear a challenge to one of the nation’s harshest abortion laws in what could be the most consequential case on abortion rights the court has taken in 23 years.  The law, known as HB2, is a Texas measure passed in 2013 that has since led to the closure of more than half the state’s abortion clinics. Out of the hundreds of new abortion restrictions lawmakers have passed since 2010, few have had such a profound impact on abortion access in a single state.  Related: It's not just Texas: abortion clinics are rapidly closing in liberal states, too  “This law is causing real harm to women across the state of Texas,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder of Whole Woman’s Health, a network of abortion clinics with four locations in Texas. “We have been fighting this draconian law since 2013 … I am hopeful that the supreme court will uphold the rights that have been in place for four decades and reaffirm that every woman should be able to make her own decision about continuing or ending a pregnancy.”  Whole Woman’s Health is one of several providers suing to overturn the law.  Before the law began to take effect, Texas had 41 abortion clinics. A provision requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges with a hospital cut that number in half, and there are 18 clinics today. A second provision of the law, which has been blocked on and off for two years, would further slash the number of providers to nine or 10. That provision mandates that all abortion clinics comply with hospital-like “ambulatory surgical center” standards, which are too expensive for most abortion providers to meet.  The stakes of the case are enormous. Texas abortion providers are challenging the supreme court to declare how far states can go in restricting abortion ostensibly to protect women’s health, which the court has never fully clarified.  In a 1992 case, Planned Parenthood v Casey, the supreme court gave states the right to restrict abortion in the interest of the woman’s health as long as the restriction is not an “undue burden”. But the court has never defined what the term means.  Abortion foes contend that a law is not an undue burden unless it takes a major toll on abortion access, while abortion rights advocates argue that a law is an undue burden if it serves no actual medical purpose. Which argument prevails could make the difference between a tidal wave of anti-abortion bills and a trickle. Conservative state lawmakers have enacted hundreds of new abortion restrictions in the past five years that mainstream medical organizations say carry no real health benefits.  “I don’t think it’s overstating the case to say if the court upholds the restrictions based on the justifications each state is offering – that these are health protective – that it would result in the most drastic reduction of the availability of abortion at any point since Roe v Wade,” Priscilla Smith, director of Yale Law School’s reproductive justice program, said last week.  Related: The biggest US city without an abortion clinic: El Paso's sole facility faces closure  A sweeping opinion on the Texas law would have immediate consequences for abortion clinics in seven other states. Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin have all passed similar laws, now mired in legal battles, which could close a combined 20 abortion clinics. Several of those states would be left with just one or two abortion providers.  A favorable ruling for abortion foes could also drive new restrictions. “If the supreme court gives the thumbs-up to these types of regulations, you will see other states follow,” said Denise Burke, vice-president of legal affairs of Americans United for Life, which supported the Texas measure. Other anti-abortion proposals, such as those restricting when and where women may use medication to end their pregnancies, may also benefit from a ruling for Texas or Mississippi.  The court on Friday did not say whether it would hear another appeal from Mississippi to enforce a harsh 2012 abortion measure. The case presents a similar constitutional question, and could be addressed by a broad ruling in the Texas case.  The Mississippi law required physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, which the state touted as a safety measure. Abortion foes derided the measure as unnecessary for patient safety and a poorly disguised attempt to shut down the state’s only clinic, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization.  Under the law, Mississippi would have become the first state without a single abortion provider since the court established the right to abortion in Roe v Wade almost 43 years ago. The fifth circuit court of appeals blocked that law in 2014.  A three-panel judge drawn from the same circuit upheld the Texas law in June. The court’s four liberal justices plus justice Anthony Kennedy temporarily blocked that decision from going into effect and closing down all but nine or 10 Texas abortion clinics. The abortion providers appealed to the supreme court in early September.  Abortion rights advocates argue that ambulatory surgical center and admitting privilege requirements are not necessary to perform safe abortions and do not make abortion safer. They see ASCs, which can cost an abortion provider millions of dollars to build and maintain, as a way of putting abortion providers out of business.  “ASC and privileges requirements do nothing to protect the health and safety of women and are incongruous with modern medical practice,” read a brief submitted to the fifth circuit by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association. “Scientific literature suggests that the safety of abortions performed in an office setting is equivalent to the safety of those performed in a hospital setting … HB2’s requirement that abortion facilities meet the standards for ASCs is devoid of any medical or scientific purpose.”  The brief noted that most abortions are simple procedures, with no incisions, and the risk of death from abortion is 0.0006%, while only 0.05%-0.2% of abortion procedures involve major complications.  Texas is a state with 5.4 million women of reproductive age. With only a handful of clinics left, researchers have estimated that nearly 2 million women would live more than 50 miles from the nearest abortion clinic. Three-quarters of a million women would live more than 200 miles away. And because wait times for an abortion would skyrocket, the number of second-trimester procedures, which are more expensive, invasive and time-intensive, could double.',1
'LURED IN BY TWO MANHATTAN PSYCHICS, TO THE TUNE OF $718,000 Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He sat in a Denny’s restaurant, drinking coffee between cigarette breaks after a long and sleepless night, answering question after question.          He knew none of it made sense: He was a successful and well-traveled professional, with close to seven figures in the bank, and plans for much more. And then he gave it all away, more than $718,000, in chunks at a time, to two Manhattan psychics.  They vowed to reunite him with the woman he loved. Even after it was discovered that she was dead. There was the 80-mile bridge made of gold, the reincarnation portal.  “I just got sucked in,” the man, Niall Rice, said in a telephone interview last week from Los Angeles. “That’s what people don’t understand. ‘How can you fall for it?’ ”  There was even, between payments to one of the psychics for a time machine to cleanse the past, a brief romance.  “It’s embarrassing now,” he said.  In May, the police arrested one of the psychics, Priscilla Kelly Delmaro, 26, after Mr. Rice sought out a private investigator and decided to press charges. She was charged with grand larceny.  The man’s identity was not revealed in court documents. But Mr. Rice, a 33-year-old British consultant, said he chose to come forward last week, after learning that the Manhattan district attorney’s office intended to allow Ms. Delmaro to plead guilty in exchange for a year in jail, and that it was unlikely that he would ever see any restitution. A hearing is set for Tuesday.  “I just want justice,” Mr. Rice said from Los Angeles, where he now lives. “I just don’t want her to do to anyone else what happened to me.”  It seems almost unfathomable that anyone could be taken in so thoroughly, with such a breathtaking level of gullibility. And so, Mr. Rice’s story begins.  By the spring of 2013, he had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in search engine optimization, drawing traffic to websites in exchange for commissions. He was raised in a poor family, and planned to buy his mother a house in England.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But he was troubled. Painfully uncomfortable in social settings, he drank heavily and used drugs, he said. That year, he flew from England to Arizona to enter a rehabilitation clinic for acute anxiety, he said. In the clinic, he met a woman named Michelle, another patient.  “We had such a strong connection, it was unbelievable,” he said. “I loved her deeply.”  But the relationship ended a couple of weeks after they left rehab, when Michelle overdosed on pills and returned to the clinic. She broke it off with Mr. Rice. He said he agreed it was for the best.  Photo  “I was moving on with my life,” he said. He came to New York and found a bed in the McKibbin lofts in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, two former warehouses filled with makeshift apartments that are often likened to a rowdy dormitory for young newcomers.  Depressed one day in August, he walked over the Williamsburg Bridge to Manhattan and spotted a psychic shop on Delancey Street. “And I went in,” he said. (In a previous written statement to the police about this day, Mr. Rice claimed to have visited a psychic in Times Square. In fact, he said on Thursday, he was on Delancey. His Times Square encounter was still two months away.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He met a psychic named Brandy. “She knew a lot of stuff,” he said. Stuff about him. “ ‘I saw that you were connected to this girl,’ ” she told him.  He told her about Michelle. “She said, ‘If you could choose, would you want to be back with her?’ ” he said.  Yes.  She asked for $2,500 that day, and he withdrew it from a nearby Chase bank. She said he would have his money back soon.  “I ended up giving her 10 grand, 12 grand in the first week,” he said. “It’s hard to explain.”  He continued. “It wasn’t like saying, ‘Give me 10 grand and I’ll tie your shoelaces,’ ” he said. “There’s a half truth in there, there’s something in it. This whole psychic scam is based on them knowing what’s going on in your life. They have a gift.”  He bought a $40,000 ring from Tiffany’s for Brandy to ward off evil spirits. He spent his birthday with her and her family, and they cooked him a steak. But he lost faith in her. He had recently visited Michelle in California, a disastrous five-minute conversation on the sidewalk. “The whole way I was caught up in it, she said afterward I was acting weird,” he said.  So he shopped around for a new psychic. He drove to work in Midtown Manhattan and parked his car in a garage near Times Square, on West 43rd Street. He noticed a psychic parlor across the street. There, he met Ms. Delmaro, who called herself Christina, Mr. Rice said.  “She somehow said all the right things,” he said. “It sounds mad now that I’m saying it.”  He led a double life. “I’d go to Christina and talk about Michelle for an hour, and go back to the office. She wouldn’t leave me alone. She was like family.” He paused and added, “I needed my mum, really.”  He kept his visits to the psychics largely to himself, but eventually mentioned Christina to a roommate at McKibbin, Lauren Horton.  “He seemed like a normal guy,” Ms. Horton, 34, a graphic designer, said Friday. But his faith in Christina, and the money he was paying her, was something else altogether.  “It was insane to me,” Ms. Horton said. “I told him many times he was out of his mind. He was convinced that if he didn’t pay her for the work she was doing for him, bad things would happen to him.” She likened his continued visits to the psychic to an addiction.  Mr. Rice moved out of East Williamsburg to an apartment on the Lower East Side, and invited Ms. Horton over for Christmas. Christina was there. “I didn’t like her because I knew what was going on,” Ms. Horton said.  In February 2014, Mr. Rice, longing to see Michelle, logged on to her Facebook page.  “I saw, ‘R.I.P.,’ ” he said. Michelle had died of a drug overdose.  Mr. Rice said he had just paid Christina $90,000 that she said was needed to build a bridge of gold in another dimension to trick an evil spirit that was haunting Michelle. He called her and told her Michelle was dead.  “Christina said, ‘Don’t believe it,’ ” he said. “ ‘If you believe it, it’s true.’ ”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  She said she could help get Michelle back — a reincarnated Michelle, a new Michelle.  Then things escalated.  “I slept with Christina,” Mr. Rice said. “We slept together once. It was a massive mistake.”  Ms. Delmaro’s lawyer, Jeffrey Cylkowski, said the relationship throws his accusations of theft into question. “If you’re involved with somebody, was it a gift?” he said.  Mr. Rice left New York and moved to California, where he had briefly lived. He said Christina emailed him constantly about visions she had of a new Michelle: “ ‘I just saw someone in the supermarket; it might have been her.’ ”  There was one last giant payment — “the big one” — for $100,000, he said. His bank asked him to confirm what he was spending the money on. A car, he said.  Christina told him she was broke because she had no time for other clients. “She was homeless, she’d lost everything for me,” Mr. Rice recalled being told. “I believed she lived in a church.”  He met and dated a woman who Christina led him to believe was the new Michelle. He questioned her, looking for common traits — “I was being weird” — and the relationship ended.  He flew back to New York and met a private investigator who identified Christina as Ms. Delmaro, who had been arrested previously in Florida. Mr. Rice pressed charges in May, giving the police bank records showing the payments.  He later acknowledged that his statements were incomplete: He accused Ms. Delmaro of taking all his money, leaving out the two months he spent consulting with the other psychic, Brandy, because he had resumed contact with her and now believed she was protecting him from possible retaliation, he said. He later amended his complaint. Brandy has not been charged with a crime.  The district attorney’s office said it would not comment on the case before it was resolved.  Mr. Rice’s misstatements, and the affair with Ms. Delmaro, did not help his case, the private investigator, Bob Nygaard, acknowledged. But they are not unusual, he said.  “The things that make a person a perfect mark also make him a bad witness,” Mr. Nygaard said. He said prosecutors could have done more to seek out other potential victims of Ms. Delmaro.  Mr. Rice went broke. He lost his apartment in Manhattan and sold his BMW, expensive watch and laptop. He asked his father for a few thousand dollars. Now, he said, he is barely making his rent payments of $500.  Last week, Mr. Rice said he wants to return to England — “I’m trying to get it together” — but acknowledged that he had been drinking again of late, including the day of the interview.  “I don’t know if I want to make money again. I’m scared to,” he said. “I want to go home, but I want to see this through.”',0
'2020 CONTRACEPTION TARGET FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS MAY BE MISSED, REPORT WARNS The number of women and girls with access to modern contraception has increased by 24 million since a landmark family planning pledge in 2012 to improve availability, but progress remains slower than projected and risks leaving millions of women behind.  The Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) report, published on Thursday, showed that 290 million women and girls in the world’s poorest countries were using modern methods of contraception by July 2015 – an unprecedented number. It said increases in contraceptive access in the past year had helped prevent 80 million unintended pregnancies and 111,000 maternal deaths in the FP2020 partnership’s 69 focus countries.  Related: 'I didn’t know I could become pregnant after having sex for the first time' | Mary Wanjiku Mwangi  Despite this progress, the partnership said it was not on track to meet its target of providing 120 million additional women and girls with access to contraception by 2020, a pledge made at the London family planning summit in 2012.    “If we continue at this rate, we risk missing our goal – and leaving millions of women and girls without the care and services they need and deserve,” the report said. “With five years remaining until 2020, FP2020 and its partners must take immediate action to accelerate progress.”  The report showed a 32% increase in bilateral funding for family planning since 2012, with the US and UK the largest donors with a combined input of $964m last year.    Jane Hobson, senior reproductive health adviser at the UK’s Department for International Development, said funding was promising but more needed to be done. “As this year’s report shows, we are not on track to reach the 2020 goal, and we all know there is a lot more to do. We all made commitments in 2012 and we have to deliver on them,” Hobson said.    “That means prioritising family planning, keeping it on the agenda, budgeting for it, coming up with the funds for global commodities, [and] tackling the discrimination that prevents particularly young people from getting the services they need,” she said.  Related: Women caught up in conflict failed by underfunding of sexual healthcare  “It means shifting social expectations so that a girl’s worth is no longer measured in early marriage and early childbearing. It means demonstrating our support publicly so that access to rights-based voluntary contraception becomes a normal part of life for communities everywhere.”  The report highlights successes in some of the partnership’s focus countries, including Indonesia where the report was intended to be launched at the international conference on family planning this month. The Bali conference was postponed until early next year due to a volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Lombok. Indonesia introduced low-cost or free family planning to eligible couples last year and has pledged to upgrade more than 23,500 family planning clinics as part of its commitment to FP2020’s goal.  The report also noted the importance of family planning provision in times of conflict and humanitarian emergencies, claiming that more than half of all maternal, newborn and child deaths occur in these situations.  International Planned Parenthood Federation’s Owain James said it was vital to give women access to contraception during times when they were most vulnerable. “Trying to increase family planning provision in emergencies, whether it is conflict or disaster relief such as Nepal recently, is so necessary. What we see is that demand for family planning increases during this time, and too often the services just aren’t there.”  Despite the challenges, FP2020 executive director Beth Schlachter remains hopeful. “Today, three years after the 2012 London summit, our partnership is stronger than ever. The challenges ahead are immense, and we must meet them with resourcefulness, determination, and a collective sense of responsibility,” she said.',1
'IMMIGRATION SANCTUARY BAN CREATES UNCERTAINTY IN NORTH CAROLINA Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  DURHAM, N.C. — A day after Gov. Pat McCrory signed a bill prohibiting so-called sanctuary city policies in North Carolina, Jose Lopez, the police chief in Durham, was assessing the effect it would have on this city, where, for the last dozen years, police officers have been instructed to limit inquiries about a person’s immigration status.          In order for Durham to comply with the new law, Chief Lopez said, the local rule would have to come off the books. Although he said he would still recommend that his officers refrain from poking their noses into immigration matters, he predicted that rumors would spread among undocumented immigrants that it was no longer safe to cooperate with the Durham police.  “That’s going to bring a distrust,” said Chief Lopez, who is of Puerto Rican descent. He was picked eight years ago to lead the police force in this old tobacco town, home to Duke University and a Hispanic population that more than doubled last decade, but will retire at the end of the year,  Photo  “It will cause individuals to flee the police, on the belief that some minor incident is going to get them deported,” he added.  Last month, Democrats in the United States Senate blocked a Republican-backed sanctuary cities bill, despite growing pressure from conservatives to crack down on local governments that refuse to fully cooperate with federal immigration officials or, in cities like Durham, to vigorously pursue immigration investigations.  But the lack of action in Washington has only increased the ferment over the issue in some cities and states across the country.  North Carolina was the first state to turn the conservative anger into legislative action after the bill’s failure in Washington when Governor McCrory, a Republican, signed its bill into law on Oct. 28.  A week later, the sheriff of San Francisco, Ross Mirkarimi, lost his bid for re-election four months after a woman, Kathryn Steinle, was fatally shot while walking on the Embarcadero waterfront. The man accused of the shooting was an unauthorized immigrant, and Ms. Steinle’s death has played a central role in the sanctuary debate nationally.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another dispute broke out in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott accused the sheriff of Dallas County, Lupe Valdez, of failing to “fully honor” Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests. Mr. Abbott, in an Oct. 26 letter to the sheriff, argued that recent changes in her policies posed “a serious danger to Texans.”  Mr. Abbott has indicated that he would push for bills targeting such policies in Texas’ legislative session in 2017. Other bills pending in Massachusetts and Michigan would punish local governments that maintained similar policies.  “We’ve got these local governments arbitrarily choosing which laws they want to abide by,” said State Senator Mike Kowall of Michigan, a Republican who introduced the bill there.  The issue, now part of the debate over immigration politics in the Republican presidential race, took hold after the killing in San Francisco.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The suspect is a Mexican national with an extensive criminal record who had been deported five times. Before the shooting, he had been released from custody by the authorities in San Francisco, who declined to respond to a federal request that the immigration authorities be notified. Sheriff Mirkarimi said he had been barred from responding by San Francisco’s sanctuary rules, which strictly limit cooperation between the police and federal immigration officials.  Like Chief Lopez and others, Sheriff Mirkarimi has defended sanctuary policies on the ground that they help build trust between local law enforcement and the immigrants living in the city.  In North Carolina, Mr. McCrory said the legislature had acted to make sure cities enforced the law.  “It is the sworn duty of all of these officers to uphold the rule of law, and the policies that are derived from these laws, which is why no one should tie the hands of our police, and our sheriffs and other law enforcement officers,” he said upon signing the bill.  It is unclear what, if any, effect the North Carolina bill will have on officers’ immigration responses in municipalities labeled sanctuary cities by conservatives in the state, a list that includes Durham, Chapel Hill, Carrboro and Charlotte.  But the law was bound to stir passions in a state where liberals and conservatives are bitterly divided, and where clashes over immigration-related issues have been commonplace since the 1990s. During that decade, North Carolina’s immigrant population grew 274 percent — the largest percentage of any state during that time.  The day after the bill signing, about 200 activists gathered outside the Executive Mansion in Raleigh for a boisterous rally. Six protesters were arrested for blocking traffic, and others waved caricatures depicting Mr. McCrory as a Klansman.  “The governor is using his political power to bring a law that’s going to cause a lot of problems,” said Gabriela Zabala, 65, a member of El Centro Hispano, a Hispanic advocacy group. “He thinks he’s going to get a lot more votes, like Trump.”  But State Representative Chris Millis, a Republican and a sponsor of the law, which was approved in both houses on largely party-line votes, said, “In North Carolina, we want to be proactive in defense of our citizens, to prevent horrific crimes like what happened in San Francisco.”  Photo  The law prohibits cities or counties from having any policy that “limits or restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law.” It also outlaws any rule that prohibits the police from gathering immigration information on individuals.  Durham is in one of the more liberal swaths of the South, where a number of city governments have long struck a more accommodating tone. The Durham City Council passed its sanctuary resolution in October 2003, and Carrboro followed suit in May 2006.  Chapel Hill, the home of the University of North Carolina’s flagship campus, strengthened its policy later that year after an Iranian-born woman, Sima Fallahi, went to the Chapel Hill police station to apply for a business permit to sell her artwork. She was sent to a federal detention center after a background check turned up a federal immigration removal order.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  It sent a shock through the community: Ms. Fallahi was a single mother who volunteered at the local natural foods store and was involved in the parent-teacher association at her child’s school. Mayor Mark Kleinschmidt, who was on the Town Council at the time, said it was a “ham-fisted” response from the government.  Ms. Fallahi was eventually granted permanent residency in the United States. But in response to her situation, the Town Council strengthened its sanctuary policy, Mr. Kleinschmidt said. It instructed the police not to detain people when background checks turn up immigration warrants that are civil in nature, and do not indicate that the person in question is a felon or “deported criminal.”  Mr. Kleinschmidt, who lost his bid for re-election this month after a campaign in which development, not immigration, was the main issue, said he was unsure what practical effect the new law would have on Chapel Hill’s law enforcement.  Capt. Chris Atack of the Police Department in neighboring Carrboro said that while his city’s immigration policy would have to be rescinded, he did not expect officers to suddenly make immigration a priority. “From a public safety standpoint, immigration has never been of interest to us,” he said.  Supporters of the law say it will prevent local governments from adopting more comprehensive sanctuary policies like those in San Francisco. And State Representative George Cleveland, the bill’s lead author, said he hoped that it would spur the police to take more vigorous action against undocumented immigrants.  “My feeling is that they would be obligated to take these people into custody,” said Mr. Cleveland, a Republican from coastal Onslow County.  Mr. Cleveland said there was some merit to the argument that such enforcement might scare off potential witnesses to crimes. But that, he said, would be the fault of the unauthorized immigrants themselves.  “If they want to live in a community where bandits can treat them any way they want to be treated because they’re afraid to point out to law enforcement who’s doing it, that’s their problem,” he said.',0
'AMARTYA SEN: WOMEN’S PROGRESS OUTDID CHINA’S ONE-CHILD POLICY Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — THE abandonment of the one-child policy in China is a momentous change, and there is much to celebrate in the easing of restrictions on human freedom in a particularly private sphere of life. But we need to recognize that the big fall in fertility in China over the decades, for which the one-child policy is often credited, has, in fact, been less related to compulsion and much more to reasoned family decisions in favor of a new norm of smaller families.          This development has been particularly helped by the increasing empowerment of Chinese women through rapid expansion of schooling and job opportunities. What China needs now is further expansion of rethinking within families to overcome “boy preference,” which is still widespread, despite being at odds with the success of Chinese women.  This is a good moment to examine what the one-child policy has done — or not done. First, we must question the glib history that China was stuck in the adversity of high fertility rates until the policy changed it all.  The one-child policy was introduced in 1978. But the fertility rate had already been falling rapidly for a decade before that — from an average of 5.87 births per woman in 1968 to 2.98 in 1978. After that huge drop, the fertility rate continued to fall with the new draconian policy in force, but there was no plunge — only a smooth continuation of the falling trend that preceded the restriction. From 2.98 in 1978, the rate has declined to 1.67 now.  Clearly, something more than the one-child policy has been affecting birthrates in China. Statistics that compare different countries, as well as empirical analysis of data from hundreds of districts within India, indicate sharply that the two most potent factors that induce fertility reduction globally are women’s schooling and women’s paid employment.  There is no mystery in this. The lives that are most battered by over-frequent bearing and rearing of children are those of young mothers, and more schooling and more gainful employment both give young women a greater voice in family decisions — a voice that tends to work in the direction of cutting down the frequency of births. Rapid expansion in China of education, including that of girls, and the enhancement of job opportunities for young women occurred through a series of decades that began well before the introduction of the one-child policy, and they have continued robustly since.  As it happens, fertility rate declines in China have been close to what we would expect on the basis of these social influences alone. China often gets too much credit from commentators on the alleged effectiveness of its harsher interventions, and far too little for the positive role of its supportive policies (including its heavy focus on education and health care, from which many other countries can learn).  Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.  So while there are harrowing reports of the hardship created in the lives of many people in China by the enforcement of the one-child policy, it is far from clear that this policy has had a large impact on the fertility rate of the population as a whole.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The removal of the one-child policy may, in fact, have been an easy choice. There is little need for the harshness of this coercive program, given the increasing role of reasoning about family decisions, and particularly the growing empowerment of Chinese women.  This takes us back to a classic disagreement between Thomas Robert Malthus and the Marquis de Condorcet in the 18th century, at the height of the Enlightenment. Condorcet had noted the possibility of terrible overpopulation; Malthus acknowledged that he was following Condorcet in this, but he hugely exaggerated the danger when he rejected Condorcet’s reassuring argument that human reasoning would produce a corrective. Condorcet had anticipated the emergence of new norms of smaller family size based on “the progress of reason.” Buttressed by the expansion of education, especially for women (of which Condorcet was one of the earliest and most vocal advocates), he argued that people would choose voluntarily to cut the birthrate.  Reasoning in decision making is not exclusive to the West. In China it clearly has played a significant part already in restraining family size. It also has other important roles to play. Despite China’s extraordinary social and economic success (not just in economic growth), it has one of the worst records in the world in the selective abortion of female fetuses; the number of girls born per 100 male births has been as low as 85, compared with a normal rate around 95 in countries where there is little or no selective intervention against female birth. Chinese women have made huge progress in most spheres of life, but traditional “boy preference” is still rampant. However, legal remedies against sex-selective abortion, like outlawing it, have been ineffective wherever they have been tried.  What is needed is more reasoning, aided by further use of women’s empowerment, against such an arbitrary and dehumanizing bias. Such a change has, in fact, been very successfully achieved in South Korea, which once also had a very low ratio of girls to boys at birth. The cultivation of active public reasoning and wider understanding of the demands of gender equity have produced a huge change there.  China needs to rely even more on the force of reasoning, rather than on legal compulsion. The removal of the one-child policy is surely an important move in that direction. The fact that China’s demographic history over the last half-century gives firm evidence of what Condorcet called “the progress of reason” certainly gives ground for optimism. This is all the more important, since China has more challenges to address in this productive way.',1
'RUSSIAN ATHLETICS BEGINS PURGE OF DOPING SCANDAL COACHES AND OFFICIALS Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video.Please install Adobe Flash ™ and try again. Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.  Russia’s athletics federation has met in Moscow to begin what the sports minister said would be a purge of its staff after the country was suspended from international competition over doping.  Russia will undertake reforms and appeal to the International Association of Athletics Federations within three months to return to competition, the sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said. At stake is the country’s participation at the world indoor championships in March and the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August.  Related: Sebastian Coe poses a very British challenge to Russia’s widespread doping | Barney Ronay  Mutko summoned the presidium of the All-Russia Athletic Federation on Sunday following the IAAF decision to indefinitely suspend Russia because of widespread violations found by a World Anti-Doping Agency commission. Mutko said on Saturday he and the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, had agreed on a “road map” for reform.  The UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, insisted that making Russian athletes miss the 2016 Rio Olympics to ensure a clean Tokyo 2020 Games would be a “price worth paying”.  “If you’ve got to have pain in Rio to ensure Tokyo is clean, so be it,” said Warner, who said he does not want a “murky compromise” to allow Russia’s return.  But Mutko told the news agency Tass that the Russian athletics federation is taking steps to ensure it will return to international competition before Rio, including replacing coaches and officials. He added he hoped its leadership would be 99% new after elections at a conference on 16 January at which a temporary federation president and presidium will be elected.  “Some may suffer in this situation, but we will remove all those whose reputation is under suspicion from the athletics management system,” Mutko said on the state television channel Rossiya 24.  “Within 60 days we will conduct a renewal of athletics, we will bring in new, modern people, we will work with the international federation to take all measures by its standards. We will take all measures recommended to us by Wada and the IAAF and in 60 days, or in three months, we will come to the international federation again so we can show that we’re meeting standards, and we hope our team will regain its rights.”  Mutko also told Rossiya 24 that Russia could turn the management of its athletics federation over to the Russian Olympic Committee, which has promised that all athletes, officials, coaches and other personnel involved in doping “will be banned from all activity related to sport and will be punished”. It is expected to lead reforms of Russia’s athletics federation, anti-doping agency and drug-testing lab.  The International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, has rowed back on his comments of Saturday that he was confident that Russia’s reform process would make the country compliant in time to compete in Rio.  Bach insisted Russian track and field athletes would only return if the country falls into line with all anti-doping rules and its reforms are verifiable. “The important goal is not bringing them back,” Bach said. “The goal has to be Russia being compliant again with all the international anti-doping regulations. If the Russian athletics federation is not compliant and the athletes cannot take part in any kind of qualifications, then the situation is clear. If you cannot qualify, you cannot participate in the Games.”  The IAAF is expected to demand Russia apologises for its behaviour, ends state interference in track and field and investigates athletes suspected of doping before it is allowed back in to competition.  Richard McLaren, a member of the Wada commission, has warned it could even recommend suspending the IAAF when it releases part two of its report, which is expected late this year. Mutko does not believe it will come to that. “If there are no athletics in Rio, it will be a complete breakdown of the Olympics,” he said. “That cannot be allowed.”',0
'1966: THE YEAR YOUTH CULTURE EXPLODED 25 March 1966, the Jefferson Airplane and the Mystery Trend played a “rock & roll dance benefit” in support of the Vietnam Day Committee. Costing $1.50 to get in, the “peace trip” was held at Harmon Gym, on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley – the institution that, after Mario Savio’s December 1964 “put your bodies on the gears” speech, had become the centre of American student radicalism, in particular the protests against the escalating Vietnam war.  The event was one of several “peace rock” benefits held in the gym that spring that cemented the link between the politicos of Berkeley and the bohemians of the nascent San Franciscan music scene: others showcased the Grateful Dead, the Great Society, and the (original) Charlatans. Citing one of these shows, the columnist Ralph Gleason observed that the city was “on the verge of another dancing craze” such as had not happened “since the swing era”. Nothing apparently untoward there.  The trouble started a few weeks later, when the San Francisco Examiner cited the Harmon Gym event in a highly critical article on Berkeley. “The sweet, acrid odour of marijuana pervaded the area, many of the dancers were obviously intoxicated,” wrote reporter Jack S McDowell. “Sexual misconduct was blatant.” The background to this was the release of an addendum to the Burns report, prepared by California’s state senate committee, which alleged communist infiltration of Berkeley’s Free Speech Movement and much more, summed up by the phrase “a deluge of filth”.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vietnam Day protest march at Berkeley. Photograph: Don Cravens/The Life Images Collection/Getty Images  Six days after the Examiner article, Ronald Reagan took the stage of the Cow Palace to deliver a defining speech of his gubernatorial campaign. He cited the Harmon Gym show as a prime example of what he called “the morality gap at Berkeley”. Conflating rock’n’roll, drugs and sex – “the nude torsos of men and women” projected by the light show – with the “filthy speech movement” and the Vietnam Day Committee, Reagan called for a root and branch examination of “the charges of communism and blatant sexual misbehaviour on the campus”. As he thundered: “What in heaven’s name does academic freedom have to do with rioting, with anarchy, with attempts to destroy the primary purpose of the university, which is to educate young people?”  Having made his name during Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign, Reagan was busy positioning himself as a figurehead in the Republican resurgence. His positions were frequently and forcefully expressed: pro-business, anti-regulation; pro-self-help (as in the the “creative society” idea – a forerunner of Cameron’s “big society”), anti-state intervention; pro-the squeezed middle-aged, anti- the long-hairs, communists and war protesters who seemingly thronged the campus of Berkeley.  Reagan’s claims about the Harmon Gym concert were, his biographer Robert Dallek concedes, “vastly exaggerated”. However they were in service to a powerful feeling: namely that, faced with the symptoms of incipient psychedelia, many adults were convinced the freedoms of popular culture and President Lyndon B Johnson’s “great society” had got out of hand. It wasn’t just sex and drugs, but anti-war protest and inner-city riot. Things were going too far too fast. It was time to apply the brakes, and Reagan would be the most visible agent of that backlash.  The 1960s remain in the folk memory as a golden age of pop culture, with 1966 enshrined in the UK as the year of swinging London and the winning of the World Cup. It was the year of the singles that are regularly collected on those TV advertised compilations you buy for £5 and under: Sunny Afternoon; Reach Out I’ll Be There; Good Vibrations; Summer in the City – mass pop art so imperishable that it cannot be dimmed by cheap nostalgia and endless repetition.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vietnam Day Committee supporters Jefferson Airplane. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images  But 1966 was a year of turmoil. It began in pop and ended in rock; began in civil rights and ended in black power; began in the great society and ended in the Republican resurgence. Inspired by the success of the civil rights movement and boosted by the money pouring into the music and youth industries, young people in the US and the UK began to think of another way of life, that didn’t involve being like your parents. They were beginning to envision what the future might be.  It was also the year that the torch passed from England to America, from London to Los Angeles, which became the central pop location, thanks to the Mamas and the Papas, the Beach Boys, and the Monkees – ersatz Beatles who bloomed just as the originals left the stage. California had its own youthtopias, reasonably autonomous zones where the young could congregate and try out new ways of living: the Haight/Ashbury in San Francisco, the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.

Pop’s Herculean acceleration resulted in many casualties: during 1966, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones all crashed out from the pace, but not before they had provocatively expressed their dissatisfaction – Dylan with his polarising electric show segments, the Beatles with their notorious “Butcher” LP sleeve (pulped by their American record company, Capitol, at a cost of $200,000), the Rolling Stones with the drag video for Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?  At the same time, there were the new total environments: the lightshows of the San Franciscan ballrooms, the op art designs of cavernous new discotheques like New York’s Cheetah, the sensorium of Andy Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable, which gave the impression of “everything occurring simultaneously”. By 1966, many strands of art, music, and entertainment were all coming to the same point by different means: the total focus on the instant that is the hallmark of many eastern religions; the happening; the drug experience; the ecstasy of dancing.  It was also a year of incredible fertility in black American music. To name just one artist: James Brown visited the UK for the first time in March; played Madison Square Garden in April; appeared on Ed Sullivan for the first time in May, with his own musicians. In late June, he was the only major pop star to play for the activists on the March Against Fear, two days after they had been tear-gassed by state troopers: this was the last great united action of the civil rights movement and the moment when Stokely Carmichael launched the idea of Black Power.  James Brown also made one of two records that, during 1966, completely exploded linear time in their respective quests for the perpetual present. The first was Tomorrow Never Knows. The second was on the flip of the single Don’t Be A Drop-Out: Brown placed a song called Tell Me That You Love Me, adapted from a live recording. Looping the vocal with a guitar figure by Lonnie Mack, Brown and producer Bud Hopgood created a shocking delirium of sound with an insanely fast drum pattern that directly prefigured drum’n’bass, nearly 30 years later.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A shocking delirium of sound ... James Brown. Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns  Pop music was the new Olympus. Lou Reed recognised it as the arena for his generation: “The music is the only live, living thing.” Writing in the same issue of Aspen magazine, Robert Shelton agreed: “The age of the new mass arts is moving us upward, inward, outward and forward. In this era of exploration, there are many breeds of navigators, but few more daring than the poet-musicians who are leading our pop music in new directions … expressing an avant-garde, underground philosophy to a mass audience, deepening the thinking of masses of young people.”  Many records by those “poet-musicians” made the charts. The most obvious example is the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations, recorded in sessions that spanned 60 hours over seven months, at a cost of $50,000. It was technological yet emotional, sensual and spiritual – designed as a moment of fusion that would reset pop culture’s polarity to positive.  What was thrilling about 1966 was the way in which things were not business as usual, a feeling that can still be heard in the records of the year: music was connected to events outside the pop culture bubble and was understood to do so by many of its listeners. It was a year when audacious ideas and experiments were at a premium in the mass market and in youth culture, with a corresponding reaction from those for whom the rate of change was too quick.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The ecstasy of dancing ... Photograph: Lövenich/ullstein bild via Getty Images  The more the young pushed forward, the more the adults pushed back. In the summer, the most famous pop group in the world came up against immutable forces: xenophobic rightwing protesters in Tokyo; the agents of President Marcos, taking physical revenge for an alleged insult; and the deep south disc jockeys who, incensed by the reprinting of John Lennon’s comments about the Beatles being “more popular than Jesus”, organised boycotts, threatened the group’s tour and conducted “Beatle Burnings”.  The polarity had flipped from positive to negative. The Beatles seemed to have become a lightning rod for all sorts of tensions that had little to do with their music: they had become a target for all those who resisted the pace of change. In August the writer James Morris declared that “the Beatles’ absolute aloofness to old prejudices and preconceptions, their brand of festive iconoclasm, has developed an attraction for me, as it has for millions more sceptics the world over”. But this iconoclasm had its dangers. As Morris quoted an elderly acquaintance: “I’ll tell you what the trouble with the Beatles is: they’ve got no respect.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Technological, but sensual and spiritual ... the Beach Boys. Photograph courtesy of Jon Savage  More than any other year thus far in that decade, it was the time when that increasingly assertive and visible youth culture collided with realpolitik. In the UK, Time magazine’s idea of Swinging London came up against the Labour government’s wage freeze: another kind of austerity. “The age of pop” seemed to be swinging “to a stop”, observed the Sunday Times that August. Late in the year, a senior Time magazine editor opined that “swingin’ has got out of hand because it is the kind of fun only a rich nation can afford – and England is no longer a rich nation.”  While Good Vibrations was rising to No 1 in the UK and the US, the anti-youth culture backlash began. Within a week of Reagan’s election as governor of California, a major disturbance erupted on the the Sunset Strip, when a protest by over a thousand teens – incensed by the heavy-handed policing of archaic curfew laws – provoked a strong reaction. With LA being a media centre, it made national news. Over the next few weeks, both sides escalated their rhetoric, climaxing in brutal police beatings on 26 November and 10 December.  What was left after the Sunset Strip riots was an unpleasant aftertaste, a harbinger of the more serious flashpoints to come. For what it seemed to come down to was generational warfare – what Derek Taylor, then the Beach Boys’ PR, called “the whole rotten issue of the Old v the Young”. As the journalist Jerry Hopkins wrote that December, just after the height of the rioting, “the fact remains that there are two factions, two sides. One generation does not understand or refuses to try to understand the one behind it … the line has been drawn.”  The young had begun to flex their muscles – to see beyond a market to a different way of life. As Time reported, “In the US, citizens of 25 and under in 1966 nearly outnumbered their elders: by 1970, there will be 100 million Americans in that age bracket … If the statistics imply change, the credentials of the younger generation guarantee it. Never have the young been so assertive or so articulate, so well educated or so worldly. Predictably, they are a highly independent breed and – to adult eyes – their independence has made them highly unpredictable.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Police search African American youths during the Watts riots. Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock  The 60s peaked in 1966; it was the year when the decade exploded. The songs from that time still enchant successive generations, but they were also a response to their place and time. It was, as the writer and cultural catalyst Tony Hall said that December, “pretty obvious that contemporary music reflects contemporary life and vice versa.” Pop did reflect the world during 1966, that there was something more than image and sales at stake.  It wasn’t just the sudden loosening of bonds caused by the Beatles’ success and the money that flowed into the youth sector. The music of that year co-existed with the move towards greater social freedom, whether in the liberalising legislation of the UK’s Labour government or the various US liberation movements, civil rights groups like the SNCC and the SCLC, the National Organisation of Women, homophile groups like the Daughters of Bilitis, Vanguard or the Mattachine Society. It spoke of the drive towards democracy and openness that makes it still contested today, that militate against the generational nostalgia that renders the period rote.  What’s fascinating is how politicised the High 60s remain. This era has consistently been denigrated by rightwing politicians over a 30 year period, since the Reagan/Thatcher era. The structures of society have been altered – in particular by laws relating to youth benefits, structural unemployment etc – to remove power from youth as a cohort. But still the High 60s are dismissed by various pundits and historians, as overhyped, unrealistic, elitist, “only a few people in London” – quite apart from the ad hominem attacks on major figures. That viewpoint – proposed by the likes of Dominic Sandbrook – in itself is interesting: why do they do it and who does it benefit?  Today’s neo-liberals see everything in strictly financial terms and seek to impose that vision on the rest of us. It’s all about money, nothing else. But, as the old saying goes, they know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. Attempting to reprogram the mid-60s in that guise, while a tempting provocation, simply succeeds in smearing the past with the values of the present. Going back to the primary sources, you enter an entirely different world. During 1966, young people were creating an exciting, progressive mass culture in plain sight. They dared to dream. For a while, they got away with it, and that spirit remains inspirational.  • 1966: The Year The Decade Exploded by Jon Savage (Faber & Faber, £20) is published on 19 November.

'NOVAK DJOKOVIC DISMANTLES KEI NISHIKORI AT ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS Kei Nishikori was the latest to succumb to the runaway train that is Novak Djokovic as the world No1 coasted to victory in his opening match at the ATP World Tour Finals in London.  Related: Jamie Murray and John Peers win dramatic ATP World Tour Finals opener  The statistics of Djokovic’s season get more impressive by the day and he needed only 65 minutes to defeat Nishikori 6-1, 6-1 and register a 23rd consecutive win. The O2 Arena turned red, white and blue prior to the match as a minute’s silence was observed for the victims of Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris.  Once attention turned back to matters on court Djokovic, who has lost just one set since his US Open final victory over Roger Federer, wasted no time in stamping his authority on the match, establishing a 3-0 lead. Nishikori battled hard to get on the board in the fourth game but that was as good as it got as the Serb, his game and his movement razor sharp, reeled off the next three.  Djokovic is even more dominant indoors than he is outside. He is unbeaten since 2012 and is bidding to become the first player to win four successive World Tour Finals titles. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nishikori looked at a loss as to how to trouble the Serb and he made the worst possible start to the second set, dropping serve for a third time.  Djokovic was playing with swagger and a nonchalant backhand volley gave him the most comfortable of opening wins.  Earlier, Jamie Murray and Australian John Peers marked their debut at the tournament with victory over the Australian Open champions Fabio Fognini and Simone Bolelli in a match that, unlike the singles, was a real contest.',0
'A GRIM BREAST CANCER MILESTONE FOR BLACK WOMEN Photo  African-American women in the United States have reached a dubious milestone. For the first time, the incidence of breast cancer among black women is equal to that of white women, according to a sweeping new report from the American Cancer Society.  The finding is worrisome because breast cancer has historically been more deadly in black women than in white women, but at least it has not been as common. Now, as incidence rates equalize, data suggests that breast cancer will continue to exact a far greater toll on black women, and that the trend shows no sign of abating.  “It is a crisis,” said Marc Hurlbert, chief mission officer for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. “The increasing incidence is unfortunate because the mortality rate for black women is already so much higher, and now if more women are getting breast cancer, then unfortunately, the number of black women dying from the disease will go up.”  Over all, the report painted a grim picture of the state of breast cancer in African-American women, showing that advances in diagnosis and treatment that have sharply improved survival rates from breast cancer and saved countless lives have largely bypassed African-American women. By virtually every measure of the disease — age of diagnosis, age of death, stage of diagnosis — black women are at a significant disadvantage compared with white women, the data show.  Photo  The reasons for the increase are complex and are thought to be driven largely by rising obesity rates among African-American women. Researchers also believe that changes in reproductive patterns may play a role, as more African-American women delay childbirth and have fewer children. Both are recognized risk factors for breast cancer.  Black women are given breast cancer diagnoses at younger ages and die from the disease at younger ages than white women, suggesting that the disease may exact a greater economic and family toll on blacks by stealing more of a woman’s most productive years. The median age at diagnosis is 58 for black women and 62 for white women. The median age for breast cancer death is 62 for black women and 68 for white women.  The data for the report was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, a program that has been collecting information on cancer patients since 1973.  Among white women, breast cancer incidence rates have been stable since 2004, hovering around 135 per 100,000 women. But among black women, rates have been consistently lower, ranging from 119 to 125 per 100,000. But in 2012, a startling change occurred. The incidence rate moved to 135 cases per 100,000 women for both white and black women.  “The lines have crossed for the first time,” said Carol E. DeSantis, senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society and the lead author of the report. “There is variation in year-to-year rates, especially in smaller populations such as in black women, but I think, over all, the picture we’ve seen is this slow steady increase in black women and stable rates in white women.”  While it is possible that a fraction of the rise could be attributed to earlier detection, that would not fully explain the trend because rates at which women are being screened for breast cancer have remained stable. As a result, the trends suggest that the uptick in incidence is not a result of doctors simply finding more cases of breast cancer, but is probably the result of other factors.  “To me the bottom line of these statistics is the evidence that the health disparity between African-American and white women in the U.S. is still going strong,” said Kirsten Moysich, a professor of oncology at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo. “And it’s even more pronounced than previously reported.”  Obesity is considered a risk factor because it has been linked to an increased risk of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, and much of the increase in breast cancers among black women has been due largely to more cases of this type of tumor. The obesity rate in black women was 58 percent during the 2009 to 2012 period, up from 39 percent from 1999 to 2002. Meanwhile, the obesity rate among white women has stabilized at around 33 percent.  Over all, a black woman given a breast cancer diagnosis is 42 percent more likely to die from the disease than a white woman with breast cancer. An analysis of breast cancer mortality trends in 41 of the largest cities in the United States, published last year in Cancer Epidemiology, found that in some cities the risk is even greater. In Los Angeles, a black woman with breast cancer is about 70 percent more likely to die from the disease than a white woman is. In Memphis, black women face more than double the risk. Black women also are less likely than white women are to be given a diagnosis of early stage disease, and more likely to be given a diagnosis with later stage, and less treatable, tumors, according to the report.  Compared with white women, black women were more likely to be found to have an aggressive form of the disease called triple negative breast cancer, which has a poorer prognosis, in part, because there are not targeted therapies to treat it. Triple negative breast cancers account for 22 percent of the cases among black women, and 11 percent among white women.  Black women also lag white women in diagnosis of estrogen-receptor positive disease, the most treatable form of breast cancer. Among white women, 76 percent of cancers diagnosed are ER positive, compared with 62 percent in black women.  Researchers say the racial divide in breast cancer mortality may be because of a combination of factors, including disparities in the quality of care available to black women, who may have less access to quality screening and treatment, compared with white women. Lower rates of follow-up after a mammogram, cultural distrust of doctors, and lack of insurance coverage among black women may also play a role.  Dr. Hurlbert said the report should prompt not only more research, but more efforts to include black women in clinical trials. “Percentage enrollment in trials has been low for black women,” Dr. Hurlbert said. “So do the drugs work as well on them? We don’t know.”  Dr. Hurlbert said there were so many unanswered questions, that it will take some time before the data begin to influence clinical practice, but he hopes doctors will take it to heart and be more vigilant when they are treating black women and offer more follow up and support when needed. He also encouraged women to talk to their doctors about genetic cancer screening and have regular mammograms.  “Because breast cancer has shown up in younger ages for black women, they should be very vigilant,” Dr. Hurlbert said. “But the really big issue is that we hope it does raise alarm bells that more needs to be done in these populations.”  Video  Related:',1
'SQUARE'S IPO: THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE UNICORN-DRIVEN TECH BUBBLE? There are a lot of people in Silicon Valley and New York betting on “unicorns” – the new breed of tech startups like Uber, Square, Airbnb and Snapchat that have been valued at least $1bn.  Not since the last dotcom boom has so much money been poured into so many hyped companies. As startup founders and their investors hope to turn their paper unicorn fortunes into cold hard cash, some of Silicon Valley’s most successful investors are warning a reckoning is coming. And on Monday that magical thinking faces one of its biggest tests.  Square, the mobile payments platform co-founded by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, will sell shares in New York at a $4bn valuation. A year ago, private investors valued Square at $6bn. Now questions are being asked about whether Dorsey can really juggle his duties at troubled Twitter and a once hot startup that has yet to show any signs of making a profit. If Monday’s initial public offering (IPO) goes badly, a lot of other profitless unicorns will start feeling the chill.    One big problem for the unicorns is that there are simply too many of them. When the term was coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013, unicorn was the perfect way to encapsulate something rare, magical and mythical: in this case, a $1bn startup.  Related: We should be suspicious of Silicon Valley unicorns and their exorbitant valuations | Mike Daisey  But analysts and investors say the version 2.0 tech bubble has inflated so much that the term unicorn no longer fits. So much private money (increasingly from established institutional investors, which previously steered clear of such risky investments) has been pumping into tech firms that $1bn startups are no longer rare, magical or mythical, and it could mean that the tech bubble is about to burst again. “I do think you’ll see some dead unicorns this year,” Bill Gurley, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Benchmark, has said.  Another VC, Todd Dagres of Spark Capital in Boston, said: “If you wake up in a room full of unicorns, you are dreaming and you can’t expect the dream to continue.”  In November 2013, only 39 tech startups had been worth $1bn pre-flotation in the past decade (Google and Amazon were worth nowhere near $1bn before their IPOs). Today there are 82 $1bn pre-IPO startups in the US and a total of 125 worldwide, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. The combined valuation of all US unicorns is $486bn – more than the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Austria, Colombia or South Africa – and not one has made any profit, as they are all concentrated on aggressively spending to expand their reach and thereby increase their valuation before floatation.  There are so many unicorns that Silicon Valley needs a new term to describe the most successful new firms: the decacorn, a made-up word for a startup worth more than $10bn. There are still quite a few of these. Uber this summer was valued at $51bn (£33.4bn) (that’s almost four times as much as Marks & Spencer is worth); Airbnb attracted $2.5bn more investment in June that valued it at $25.5bn (£16.8bn); and Snapchat’s latest funding round valued the disappearing-photo app at $16bn (£10.5bn).  There is a growing unease among investors that few, if any, of these companies are really worth the valuations they have attracted, which would make the tech bubble burst as it did at the turn of the century.  Attention this week turned to Snapchat when established mutual fund Fidelity wrote down the value of its investment in the four-year-old company, which is used by more than 100m people a day, by 25%. Fidelity has also written down its stake in Dropbox, the cloud storage company, by 31%, and the company has quietly dropped its IPO plans. In 2014 it was valued at $10bn, but its bankers have warned it will struggle to attract anywhere near that on the public market.  Eyes are now turning towards Square – a payment system that allows anyone to take credit payments via a card reader attached to an iPad – which has announced its plans to float in New York. But it won’t be a celebratory moment for all investors.  Square, which gave potential investors a square-shaped 250-page prospectus over lunch in Manhattan’s chic Midtown Loft & Terrace this week, is also facing questions over the abilities of Dorsey. His other company, Twitter is failing to match Wall Street’s expectations on revenue or profits, and user growth has all but dried up with new users increasing by just 1.3% in its latest quarter. The company’s shares, which peaked at $69 in January 2014, were changing hands for $26 on Friday – the exact value they were floated at in November 2013. Dorsey, 38, is currently juggling the CEO role of both companies.  Many feel Square’s IPO could, in hindsight, be seen as the trigger that burst the 2.0 tech bubble, that it could wipe billions off the values of the biggest beasts such as Uber that are hoping to follow it down the IPO path.  Ominously, as the company announced the price range its former chief operating officer Keith Rabois tweeted: “The steroid era of start-ups is over.”  “I think Square is the beginning of the end of the tech bubble,” Sam Hamadeh, founder and chief executive of financial research firm PrivCo, said. “In terms of the number of unicorns, I have never seen anything like it in 25 years.    “With Square, not only is it the first one where investors are being asked to take a haircut going into it, but I think it will get worse. What already sounds horrible will go on to be terrible.”  Hamadeh said he expects some of Square’s early investors will lose out on their original investments, while late-stage investors have been guaranteed at least a 20% return on the $15.46 they paid last year on the IPO. The company has promised to issue new shares to pay for that return if the shares don’t achieve it in the flotation.  Investors will look back and say ‘That was insane’, and the date everyone starts to realise that will be Square’s IPO Sam Hamadeh, PrivCo founder and chief executive  He said investors are prepared to accept a loss, as they have “come to the realisation that ‘yes, we overpaid’”.  “It’s not just Square – a lot of these unicorn funding rounds have been massively overpaid. It is because there has been a disproportionately large amount of investment from established firms that did not invest in startups five years ago, but have gotten into it because they feel they have been missing out,” he said. “But they will be the biggest losers. In our opinion, they have no business being in this space; they will look back and say ‘That was insane’, and the date everyone starts to realise that will be the date of Square’s IPO.”  Alan Patrick, co-founder of technology consultancy Broadsight, agreed that there has been too much “irrational enthusiasm” for investing in startups, and it is unlikely to be matched by what the market is prepared to pay at IPOs. “The private market has been driving these valuations to extraordinary levels, and as they approach the public market the smart money is starting look at it and go ‘oh no, no, no’.  “The number of unicorns is a sign that there is a bubble in the private market – in the dotcom era there were 10 or something, now there are too many to count,” he said. “That for me is a sign that these values are untested and out of step with reality. And none of them are making money, they are all buying revenue with huge war chests.”  Patrick reckoned the 2.0 tech bubble will come to be defined by the unicorn. “Whether it’s the ‘big swinging dick’ of the last one [the build-up to the financial crisis], there is alway a name that attached to a bubble; for this one it will be the unicorn.”  But he added that he doesn’t think the bubble is about to burst just yet. For that to happen, he said, there needs to be an “insanity event” – “something that in hindsight is so extraordinarily crazy, but looked normal at time”.  “Last time it was AOL-Time Warner [a $165bn takeover]. It’ll be an event when everyone goes, ‘Oh my god, that was nuts’,” he said. “That’s what I’m waiting for, and when that happens you blow the whistle.”',0
'THE END OF THE LINE FOR INDIA’S ICONIC RAILWAY BUFFET CAR The world outside the window changes quickly and often: farmers labouring in the fields, office workers making the daily commute, kids playing cricket wherever there’s enough space for a game. I’m on the Suvidha Special, a sleeper train from the southern city of Bangalore to Kolkata, 1,200 miles to the north-east.  A man in a uniform hovers above my seat, asking a question so often heard in India: “Veg or non-veg?” The pantry car, from where my meal will be prepared before being brought to and served at my seat, is an Indian institution.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alamy  India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, sees high-speed trains as crucial to the country’s development. He does not feel the same way about the iconic pantry car. Indian Railways will soon phase them out and replace them with “e-catering” and takeaways, “because people want different types of food,” says a railway spokesman. “This way we can offer pizza, burgers or continental [European] food.”  On the Suvidha, meals are included in the price of the ticket (about £6 for the meal package, whichever class you’re in), and the attendant comes around, giving out bedding. Then comes the food – served to your berth, eaten off your lap.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alamy  For breakfast, staff dish out omelettes, bread and butter on the side. Lunch comes packed in aluminium foil containers: there’s dal, rice and roti, a flavoursome yellow gravy masking a couple of overcooked eggs, a pot of curd to aid digestion, and vanilla ice-cream for dessert. In between, waiters pour countless rounds of slightly spicy, very sweet chai, served in an espresso-sized paper cups.  The Suvidha trundles up the east coast of India, alongside the Bay of Bengal, continues on towards the lower Ganges Delta. The journey takes 30 hours – but I’m sure it will feel much longer without the pantry car staff doing the rounds, without the question they pose to passengers three times a day: “Veg or non-veg?”',0
'IBM’S DESIGN-CENTERED STRATEGY TO SET FREE THE SQUARES Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Phil Gilbert is a tall man with a shaved head and wire-rimmed glasses. He typically wears cowboy boots and bluejeans to work — hardly unusual these days, except he’s an executive at IBM, a company that still has a button-down suit-and-tie reputation. And in case you don’t get the message from his wardrobe, there’s a huge black-and-white photograph hanging in his office of a young Bob Dylan, hunched over sheet music, making changes to songs in the “Highway 61 Revisited” album. It’s an image, Mr. Gilbert will tell you, that conveys both a rebel spirit and hard work.          Let’s not get carried away. Mr. Gilbert, who is 59 years old, is not trying to redefine an entire generation. On the other hand, he wants to change the habits of a huge company as it tries to adjust to a new era, and that is no small task.  IBM, like many established companies, is confronting the relentless advance of digital technology. For these companies, the question is: Can you grow in the new businesses faster than your older, lucrative businesses decline?  Photo  Mr. Gilbert answers that question with something called design thinking. (His title is general manager of design.) Among other things, design thinking flips traditional technology product development on its head. The old way is that you come up with a new product idea and then try to sell it to customers. In the design thinking way, the idea is to identify users’ needs as a starting point.  Mr. Gilbert and his team talk a lot about “iteration cycles,” “lateral thinking,” “user journeys” and “empathy maps.” To the uninitiated, the canons of design thinking can sound mushy and self-evident. But across corporate America, there is a rising enthusiasm for design thinking not only to develop products but also to guide strategy and shape decisions of all kinds. The September cover article of the Harvard Business Review was “The Evolution of Design Thinking.” Venture capital firms are hiring design experts, and so are companies in many industries.  Still, the IBM initiative stands out. The company is well on its way to hiring more than 1,000 professional designers, and much of its management work force is being trained in design thinking. “I’ve never seen any company implement it on the scale of IBM,” said William Burnett, executive director of the design program at Stanford University. “To try to change a culture in a company that size is a daunting task.”  Daunting seems an understatement. IBM has more than 370,000 employees. While its revenues are huge, the company’s quarterly reports have shown them steadily declining in the last two years. The falloff in revenue is partly intentional, as the company sold off less profitable operations, but the sometimes disappointing profits are not, and they reflect IBM’s struggle with its transition. Last month, the company shaved its profit target for 2015.  In recent years, the company has invested heavily in new fields, including data analytics, cloud computing, mobile technology, security, social media software for business and its Watson artificial intelligence technology. Those businesses are growing rapidly, generating revenue of $25 billion last year, and IBM forecasts that they will contribute $40 billion by 2018, through internal growth and acquisitions. Just recently, for example, IBM agreed to pay $2 billion for the Weather Company (not including its television channel), gaining its real-time and historical weather data to feed into Watson and analytics software.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But IBM’s biggest businesses are still the traditional ones — conventional hardware, software and services — which contribute 60 percent of its revenue and most of its profit. And these IBM mainstays are vulnerable, as customers increasingly prefer to buy software as a service, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers.  Virginia M. Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, has warned that this will be a difficult transition year. It will take time, she says, before its new businesses are large enough to become engines of growth for the whole company. The strategy, she insists, is the right one. What remains is to move ahead faster. “People ask, ‘Is there a silver bullet?’” Ms. Rometty said in a recent interview. “The silver bullet, you might say, is speed, this idea of speed.”  Ms. Rometty is pulling other levers to accelerate the pace of change at IBM, but she said, “Design thinking is at the center.”  Breaking With the Past  Recognizing the importance of design is not new, certainly not at IBM. In the 1950s, Thomas J. Watson Jr., then the company’s chief executive, brought on Eliot Noyes, a distinguished architect and industrial designer, to guide a design program at IBM. And Noyes, in turn, tapped others including Paul Rand, Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen in helping design everything from corporate buildings to the eight-bar corporate logo to the IBM Selectric typewriter with its golf-ball-shaped head.  At that time, and for many years, design meant creating eye-pleasing, functional products. Now design thinking has broader aims, as a faster, more productive way of organizing work: Look at problems first through the prism of users’ needs, research those needs with real people and then build prototype products quickly.  Defining problems more expansively is part of the design-thinking ethos. At a course in New York recently, a group of IBM managers were given pads and felt-tip pens and told to sketch designs for “the thing that holds flowers on a table” in two minutes. The results, predictably, were vases of different sizes and shapes.  Next, they were given two minutes to design “a better way for people to enjoy flowers in their home.” In Round 2, the ideas included wall placements, a rotating flower pot run by solar power and a software app for displaying images of flowers on a home TV screen.  Mr. Gilbert came to design thinking as a technologist and a software entrepreneur. He helped build Lombardi Software, in Austin, Tex., first as its chief technology officer and then president. Over the years, in trying to develop software faster and to improve products, he studied and adopted some of the design principles of people like David Kelley, chairman of the global design company IDEO and a founder of the Stanford design program.  Photo  In 2010, when IBM bought Lombardi Software, with its 220 people, he had no inkling of what lay ahead for him.  When Ms. Rometty became chief executive in January 2012, she told her executive team that she wanted to improve — “to rethink and reimagine” — the experience of IBM’s customers. This was motivated partly by a shift in how businesses were buying technology. As more purchased software as a service over the Internet, buying decisions were often being made by workers in functional departments — human relations, sales, marketing and data analytics — rather than by a central corporate information technology office. In this new market, software that was tailored to workers’ needs and could be used without technical help from IT employees would win the day.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At a top-management meeting, Robert J. LeBlanc, a senior software executive, mentioned that there was a guy in Austin, at a start-up IBM had acquired, who was a design and user-experience fanatic. Mr. LeBlanc called Mr. Gilbert and asked if he thought the design work he was doing in a small corner of the software business could be done across IBM. Mr. Gilbert replied that he didn’t know but it was worth considering. After a couple of days’ study, Mr. Gilbert came back and said that to have an impact, IBM had to be prepared to hire and train 1,000 designers.  Mr. Gilbert assumed that would be the end of the matter. But two weeks later, he got a call from Ms. Rometty. “Go,” she said, as he recalled. “And how fast can you go? How many can you hire in the first year?”  The Need for Speed  Since the program began in August 2012, IBM has hired several hundred designers, about two-thirds of them freshly minted college graduates and a third experienced designers. By the end of this year, IBM plans to have 1,100 designers working throughout the company, on the way to a target total of 1,500. They are embedded in IBM product teams and work alongside customers in the field or at one of 24 design studios around the world.  IBM has hired designers from top schools like Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the Rhode Island School of Design and Parsons School of Design. But initially, recruiting required skillful persuasion. When Mr. Gilbert first showed up at the graduate design school at Stanford, he was greeted with skepticism. “These are millennials in Silicon Valley — they think Google is an old company,” Mr. Burnett said, recalling their first impression. “To them, IBM was a historical relic.”  Photo  The recruiting pitch made by Mr. Gilbert and his colleagues has been essentially twofold: First, you can make a difference in socially important fields because IBM’s technology plays a crucial role in health care, energy, transportation, water and even agriculture. Second, you can be part of a groundbreaking effort to apply design thinking in business.  At Stanford, the prevailing view of working for IBM, Mr. Burnett said, has shifted from “Are you kidding me?” to “This is a pretty interesting opportunity.”  Joe Kendall thinks so. Mr. Kendall, 28, finished a two-year graduate design program at Stanford and joined IBM in June. He chose IBM over Apple, where he would have worked in its iPhone business. At Apple, he figured, his opportunity would be to help make a great product a little bit better. At IBM, Mr. Kendall sees a different opportunity. “No one is using design thinking to solve problems on this scale,” he said, adding that he could be part of “changing the future of this giant entity.”  IBM’s senior managers have all been through design training. Ms. Rometty and her executive team were among the first. The training varies, with executives getting one-day sessions; product managers, a week; and new designers, three-month programs. In all, about 8,000 IBM employees so far have had some in-person training in design thinking. It’s an impressive number, but it’s also only 2 percent of the work force.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  How broadly design thinking is being embraced across IBM is hard to say. It is a new, unfamiliar ingredient in the corporate mix. Doug Powell, a leading design expert who joined Mr. Gilbert’s team in 2013, said, “It’s not as though the masses of IBM were waiting for us to arrive.”  The incubator for the company’s ambitious experiment in corporate culture renovation can be found in a building on a corporate campus in Austin. Above a sprawling open-plan space, metal tracks fit movable whiteboard walls, creating temporary rooms — “huddle spaces” — for small teams of workers, rarely more than a dozen. The walls are covered with drawings, text and Post-it notes — “idea parking lots,” they’re called. If teams have to travel and don’t meet for a week or two, the walls come down and are stored in steel transport carts, notes and sketches intact.  The space constantly changes, as teams form or disband, add people or shed them, according to the nature of the work.  Photo  “In a week, every one of these configurations will be different,” Mr. Gilbert observed, as he toured the floor.  The work groups assemble from across IBM — hardware, software and services, but also from departments like marketing and communications. Customers are often in the mix, especially when collaborating with IBM developers to write cloud software applications. Getting clients into the free-form work space, Mr. Gilbert said, can help “fundamentally change their relationship with IBM.”  That proved to be the case for GameStop, a video game and electronics retailer. Jeff Donaldson, a GameStop technology executive, recalled that IBM’s reputation at the company’s suburban Dallas headquarters was as a slow-moving corporate bureaucracy, dominated by a sales culture offering expensive hardware and software. The reputation, he said, was “certainly not positive.”  But in the last year or so, the two companies have worked side by side — often in IBM’s Austin studio — to figure out better ways to serve GameStop customers with mobile devices and data. The floor staff at GameStop’s more than 4,100 stores in the United States can now tap iPads to look up the past purchases of customers who have downloaded the GameStop app or joined the company’s loyalty program. Coupons, trade-ins and loyalty-point rewards can be offered on the spot, as well as game recommendations.  The cloud software to make it happen was built in a few months, tested in a small group of stores and then quickly rolled out nationwide. Further projects are in the works to study how online behavior affects buying patterns.  “They’ve completely turned us around,” Mr. Donaldson said. “We’re working with the fast company part of IBM.”  Strength From Adversity  If you ask people inside IBM for a design-thinking success story, they are likely to mention Bluemix, a software tool kit for making cloud applications. In just one year, Bluemix went from an idea to a software platform that has attracted many developers, who are making apps used in industries as varied as consumer banking and wine retailing. In the past, building that kind of technology ecosystem would have taken years.  Photo  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Software developers are just as important as customers to IBM, since both groups create markets. “We wanted to redefine IBM for developers,” said Damion Heredia, an IBM vice president who leads the Bluemix operation.  Like most of IBM’s new units, Bluemix is run much like a start-up, at arm’s length from the corporate bureaucracy. Mr. Heredia, who worked closely with Mr. Gilbert for years, is steeped in design-thinking methods. His team studied how young programmers built cloud apps. Tarun Gangwani, a manager in the Bluemix unit, recalled traveling to all-night “hackathons” to watch developers as they worked, step by step. Guided by what they learned, the Bluemix team built prototype software, tested it with users, and modified and refined it.  When a free test version of Bluemix was offered in February 2014, Mr. Heredia figured it might attract 2,000 developers in the first few months. It reached that number within a week, and a commercial version was introduced that July. Today, Bluemix is signing up 10,000 new users a week.  As software becomes more an online service, analysts say, the big corporate contracts that have sustained IBM’s software business will become less frequent. “For IBM, the dollars are going to have to come from sharply expanding its customer base so that developers at all kinds of companies, including start-ups, see IBM as a place to go to build new things,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst of the market research firm IDC. “That’s not been IBM’s reputation, and that’s the challenge Bluemix faces.”  IBM has an impressive track record of corporate evolution over its 104-year history. At different times, the minicomputer, the personal computer and the Internet were seen as threats to its survival. IBM’s deepest crisis — and revival — came in the 1990s after the collapsing economics of the mainframe business sent it into a tailspin. IBM was often late to new markets, but each time it adapted.  The company’s predicament today has echoes of the past. IBM is gaining ground now, but it was late to the cloud business, behind Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Salesforce. The company’s financial performance is deteriorating, but it is still a corporation that generated nearly $16 billion in net profit from continuing operations last year. Its old-line businesses are in retreat, but with Watson it seems to be at the forefront of applying data-driven artificial intelligence to mainstream industries.  John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees several of the new businesses and research, is a 36-year IBM veteran who has experienced plenty of ups and downs and shifts in strategy.  This time, Mr. Kelly observed, is different in one way. “In the past, we changed what we were working on, but we were pretty much working the same way,” he said. “Now, we’re changing how we work too. And the how element is always related to speed.”  The pace and trajectory of the business are the big questions about IBM today. IBM’s stock price has declined 16 percent in the last year. Ms. Rometty is under pressure — and that pressure will not ease until its new businesses overshadow its legacy products. “The theory is that the new lines of business grow faster than the old ones decline, but we’ve not seen it yet,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.  Asked what she tells anxious large shareholders, Ms. Rometty replied that “the key message” is that IBM is the only technology company that is more than a century old because it has reinvented itself repeatedly in the past, and it is doing so again today. “And that does take some time — yes, it does,” Ms. Rometty said. “But don’t underestimate us. This is in our DNA, this ability to transform.”',0
'WHITE HOUSE TO ANNOUNCE $118 MILLION PUBLIC, PRIVATE EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS OF COLOR   (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  The White House Council on Women and Girls will host an all-day forum Friday to explore ways to improve the lives of women and girls of color, including a commitment of $118 million in assistance from public and private organizations.  The initiative comes after President Obama, during a speech several weeks ago, called for more attention to the "real and persistent challenges" faced by women and girls of color, including lower incomes, higher rates of serious illness and more exposure to violence. The Obama administration last year launched a major initiative, "My Brother's Keeper," aimed at black boys and young men, and has been chided by some groups for not including girls and young women of color.  [Obama's call to lift up black women gets applause, but some want a specific plan]  Participants in Friday's forum will discuss a report, "Advancing Equity for Women and Girls of Color," that identifies several areas of focus, including education, criminal justice, health and economic conditions. In the area of education, the report calls for finding ways to reduce the disproportionately high rate of school suspension for girls of color, as well as encouraging more of them to study STEM fields.  The Ms. Foundation and Prosperity Together, a collaboration of 20 women's foundations, have pledged $100 million over five years to develop programs to lift women and girls out of poverty. The money could be used to provide job training, encourage women to open businesses or pay for child care so that women can go to work.  Another $18 million has been pledged by the Collaborative to Advance Equity through Research, which will study and collect data to help identify challenges faced by women and girls of color and solutions to those challenges. That effort will be led by the Anna Julia Cooper Center at Wake Forest University, which is co-hosting Friday's forum.  You can watch the forum here.',1
'HOW ‘REAL HOUSEWIVES’ HIT A NEW LOW WITH A BIZARRE ‘FAKE CANCER’ STORYLINE   Meghan Edmonds, Terry Dubrow, Brooks Ayers, Heather Dubrow, Vicki Gunvalson on ‘Real Housewives of Orange County.’ (Vivian Zink/Bravo)  (This is the 12th installment in a series that looks at the most fascinating, intriguing or just disturbing celebrity news of the week.)  (Note: This story has been updated with a statement from E!)  Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise has shown some crazy things. Like, “throwing a prosthetic leg across the room” crazy. This season, though, it hit a new low with fake cancer.  Yes, a sordid fake cancer scandal took over “Real Housewives of Orange County” Season 10, which technically wrapped last week with a third reunion show. However, the network decided to wring every last bit of drama and aired yet another follow-up on Thursday night called “Brooks Tells All.” It centered on Brooks Ayers (ex-boyfriend of cast member Vicki Gunvalson) insisting that he does have cancer, as he has done repeatedly for the past several months, even though everyone thinks he’s lying about being sick.  This has been a major storyline during the season, as the other women despise Ayers. One cast member, who went so far as to call Ayers’s doctor to fact-check, theorized on the show that he’s pretending to have cancer so he won’t have to pay child support. Ayers has repeatedly given detailed interviews about his cancer treatments and blames the the show for manufacturing a storyline around him. For what it’s worth, the “Brooks Tells All” special was filmed several weeks ago; in the meantime, Ayers has admitted he forged medical documents that supposedly proved he underwent chemotherapy. Still, he maintains that he has cancer and he’s keeping the real medical details to himself. (Bravo declined to elaborate on the Ayers situation.)  [What to expect on ‘The Real Housewives of Potomac’]  This is a convoluted mess, to say the least. And one has to wonder why Bravo or producers thought this was a good idea for a storyline. Everyone knows producers edit footage to create the most compelling plots; Ayers didn’t have to be a major part of the season. But apparently “possibly fake cancer” was too juicy to pass up to increase viewership, even if it is incredibly offensive – both to perpetrate a hoax like that, and frankly, to speculate that one exists.  “Millions of people are battling cancer and would give anything to be cured,” fumed Melanie Bromley, the E! News correspondent who interviewed Ayers when he supplied the fake medical documents. “What about the people who were in any way inspired by Brooks and his so-called candor?”  It’s a great point — except that E!, which shares a parent company with Bravo, was instrumental in pushing this story along. First, Bravo was so excited about this storyline that the very first trailer for the season showed cast members saying they didn’t believe Ayers had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as he claimed. Cast member Meghan Edmonds then teased her doubts to Star magazine, urging viewers to watch: “I believe the little questions that unfold will intrigue the audience,” she said.  Intrigue, offend, infuriate … what’s the difference? None, honestly, when it comes to reality television because viewers are viewers. But the whole situation became more cringeworthy when the controversy spilled into real life. After the season aired, E! started “investigating,” inviting Ayers on E! News for an interview in which he shared his side of the story and provided medical documents proving his chemotherapy treatments. Then, E! quickly published follow-up articles where they tore apart his claims, including a story boasting that they found “six inconsistencies exposed in his medical documents” from City of Hope hospital.  An E! spokesman said in a statement, “E! News is a news organization that investigates and reports on entertainment and pop culture stories independently.”  “Well, the truth is finally coming out tonight!” E! News co-host Jason Kennedy gleefully said on a broadcast this week. “We have exclusive proof that Brooks may have made the biggest lie in reality TV history.”  “I think he underestimated us here at E! News,” co-host Maria Menounos chimed in. “We did our homework.”  In other words, E! confirmed with the City of Hope that Ayers was never a patient. Bravo’s Web site quickly jumped on the story, citing E! and plugging the “Brooks Tells All” special. (Later, a City of Hope spokeswoman gave us the same statement and refused to answer any other questions.)  While it’s quite a coincidence that E! happened to land these details about a controversy going on over at its sister channel, Ayers eventually admitted to the network that he fabricated the medical documents so people would stop doubting him. “My sincerest apologies to my family, friends, loved ones, and those who are battling this horrid disease,” he said, insisting again that he does have cancer and the real details of his treatment will remain private. At this point, a spokeswoman for Ayers told us she advised her client against speaking to E! again, and after he did, she resigned from working with him.  On Thursday, Bravo’s “Brooks Tell All” special was also awkward. Ayers and Cohen battled back and forth on the details of Ayers’s health, with Ayers having an answer for every suspicious detail and Cohen looking on in disbelief. Ayers also blamed misunderstandings about his health on Gunvalson, whom he says didn’t always tell the truth.  Speaking of which, E! is also still going strong with stories, now looking at how Gunvalson could have lied and publishing reactions from the cast. (On the reunion, Gunvalson admitted to fabricating some details about Ayers to gain “compassion” from her friends.) Gunvalson, who broke up with Ayers in August after filming was completed, was originally furious that they questioned his integrity. “What does Brooks need to do? Die to prove everyone wrong?” she said in one episode. Now, she’s distancing herself from her ex, saying on Twitter that she’ll never speak to Ayers again and giving interviews saying how much she hates him, further fueling the gossip cycle.  Feeling queasy yet? While it’s one thing to have a salacious plot in a reality TV show, it’s another to center it on a deadly disease and drag it out into the real world, where people truly suffering from illness don’t need to see daily headlines about someone maybe faking cancer. As this whole stomach-turning situation continues to spin out of control, here’s hoping that a reality show doesn’t feel the need to go down this path again, no matter how many viewers that it tempts to bring.

'WHY MEN GET ALL THE CREDIT WHEN THEY WORK WITH WOMEN   Janet Yellen, Chair of the Federal Reserve, is married to Georgetown economist George Akerlof. In economist power couples, the women often get slighted by the press.(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)  When Princeton professor Angus Deaton co-authored a buzzed-about report this month on dying middle-aged whites, many journalists munged the order of the names. They mentioned Deaton first, as if it were mainly his paper, and not an equal collaboration with his wife.  There we go again.  Her name is Anne Case, and her name came first on the study. She’s a widely-respected professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton. But apparently, Case’s sterling credentials are no match for our unconscious biases.  The press might be forgiven for fixating on Angus Deaton, who won a Nobel Prize last month. But, as economist Justin Wolfers pointed out on Wednesday, the media has a nasty habit of treating female economists like second-class citizens. He noted several recent examples of journalists leaving women’s names as an afterthought.  Academics can be very sensitive about who receives credit for joint papers. In economics, there’s a convention that names on a paper go alphabetically, and collaborators contribute roughly the same amount of work. So, “Anne Case and Angus Deaton,” not the other way around. To switch the names would be unusual; it would imply that Deaton did the lion’s share of the work.  Wolfers blames gender stereotypes for spurring these (likely accidental) slights. “Close your eyes for a moment, and picture an economist,” he writes. “Odds are you pictured a man.”  But the bias is not just a failing of the press; economists themselves seem to systematically undervalue women’s contributions to group work.  Heather Sarsons, a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard, recently compiled four decades of records on over 500 tenure decisions at the top 30 economics schools in the nation. During the tenure process at a university, young professors race to do as much research as possible to prove they deserve a permanent position on the faculty. The number of papers they publish in journals is one important measure of their performance.  According to Sarson’s preliminary results, it doesn’t affect a male economist’s chances at tenure if he publishes papers on his own, or with collaborators. But female economists are punished if they co-author.  "When it's not clear who did the work, or who had the idea behind something, men seem to get more credit," Sarsons says.  In this chart from her paper, she shows that male economists get tenure about 75 percent of the time, regardless of whether they wrote most of their papers in groups, or solo. But women who co-author most of their papers only get tenure about 50 percent of the time. In contrast, women who solo-author most of their papers get tenure at about the same rate as men.  "While an additional coauthored paper increases the probability of receiving tenure," Sarsons writes in the paper, "it helps a man more than it helps a woman."  As further evidence that men are receiving credit for women's contributions, Sarsons shows that the penalty for co-authorship only exists when women work with men. When women work on a paper exclusively with other women, that penalty disappears. When men and women collaborate, however, men seem to soak up all the credit from the women.  One simple way to clear up any misunderstandings is to order the names according to who did the most work. That's the convention in most fields, including sociology, which Sarsons also analyzed for her study. The work is still in progress, but so far, Sarsons finds that there is no co-authorship penalty for women in sociology. It's possible that sociology, which has many more women than economics, is simply less biased. But it's also likely no coincidence that sociology papers clearly indicate who gets more credit.  In economics papers, the ambiguity about credit that seems to offer fertile ground for unconscious (or conscious) bias -- sometimes with less provocative implications. This has led to another weird phenomenon — economists with names that are earlier in the alphabet tend to be over-represented at top economics departments, and they are more likely to win prestigious prizes, according to economists Liran Einav and Leeat Yariv. At the top 5 economics departments, having a name one letter closer to the start of the alphabet makes you one percent more likely to get tenure.  By dint of orthography, these early-alphabet names are the ones most likely to be listed first on a paper. Even though being the first author is meaningless in economics, there do exist some benefits. It's the first author whose name shows up in indexes and bibliographies. In the interest of brevity, journalists often mention a paper by the name of the first author only. Einav and Yariv point out that the pattern of alphabetical advantage doesn't exist in psychology, where authors are listed by size of their contributions.  Bias, in other words, shows up in the darnedest places. But economics is particularly notorious among the social sciences for bias against women. Women are less likely to get tenure, and less likely to get promoted to full professor. "It's something systemic to the field," Harvard economist Claudia Goldin said to the Richmond Fed's magazine in 2013.  Sarsons's research may explain some of the sexism in economics by pointing out another way that women may be discriminated against. The idea is broader than that, though. Whenever women work in groups with men, it's possible that their contributions might be discounted.  The funny thing is that research shows women make groupwork a lot more efficient, in part because they're on average better at reading people's emotions. Women also tend to prefer working collaboratively. Yet, for all their contributions to the team, experiments also show that women are less likely to and claim their rightful share of the credit, particularly when their teammates are men.  Economics offers a real-world example of what happens when it's unclear who gets credit for what. People assume — and women seem to lose out.  Right now, Sarsons is surveying female economists to find out if they have personally noticed this phenomenon, and if they have become wary of working with men as a result. In her own paper, Sarsons seems to have taken the lesson to heart.  "This paper is intentionally solo-authored," she writes in a footnote.',1
'‘APPOMATTOX’: A SUPERB NIGHT AT THE OPERA. Tom Fox portrays President Abraham Lincoln in Act 1 of Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton’s opera “Appomattox.” “We have Abraham Lincoln in the first act and LBJ in the second act,” Glass says. “I don’t know that there were any greater presidents between those two.” Fox also portrays LBJ in Act 2.  Tom Fox portrays President Abraham Lincoln in Act 1 of Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton’s opera “Appomattox.” “We have Abraham Lincoln in the first act and LBJ in the second act,” Glass says. “I don’t know that there were any greater presidents between those two.” Fox also portrays LBJ in Act 2. Matt McClain/The Washington Post  Something important happened at the Kennedy Center on Saturday night, and it was an opera called “Appomattox.”  Another opera of that name, by Philip Glass and Christopher Hampton, had its world premiere in San Francisco in 2007. The opera that the Washington National Opera opened on Saturday is also called “Appomattox,” and is also by Glass and Hampton, but it’s a complete revision of the first opera, with an entirely new second act. And although I didn’t see the opera in San Francisco, I can say that if you didn’t see this Act II, which manages to bring Martin Luther King and LBJ and their contemporaries to musical life without being stilted or preachy or eye-rolling, and which sears across the stage like a firework of light and color and rage and pain and beauty, then you haven’t yet really seen “Appomattox.”  Forget what you think you know about Philip Glass — or remember it and wonder, because the score is unmistakably Glass without having many of the traits detractors tend to associate with the composer. You can certainly hear those so-called Minimalist patterns going on in the orchestra, taxing the players’ fingers with their repetitions, but in the service of raw operatic emotion, underneath incisive and dramatic vocal writing. And you can certainly say there’s something film-like about this opera by a composer who’s written a number of film scores, but film-like in the sense of being so engrossing that you are pulled in without fully remembering where you are — something that happens a lot more often in film than in contemporary opera.  Glass is one of the most prolific and most-performed opera composers working today — he’s written 27 of them. “Appomattox” shows he’s attained mastery in the genre — and is, of those I’ve seen, by far the most moving.  [Gallery: The faces of “Appomattox”]  What happened, I think, is that the revisions got to the heart of what Hampton and Glass actually wanted to say. The original “Appomattox,” largely preserved in Act I, is about the Civil War, and is plenty colorful itself as it outlines the events leading up to the honorably worked-out truce that ended the war and freed the slaves. It starts with an opening vignette of a chorus of black soldiers singing “Tenting tonight on the old camp ground,” spread across the proscenium like a widescreen film in Tazewell Thompson’s production, followed by an ensemble of intertwining women’s voices as Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant, Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Lincoln’s dressmaker, sing “war is sorrowful,” which though lovely is the nearest the opera gets to cliché.  The meat of the act, though, are the exchanges between Lincoln (Tom Fox) and Frederick Douglass (Soloman Howard) at Lincoln’s second inaugural, when Douglass demands the vote for black citizens; and between Robert E. Lee (David Pittsinger) and Ulysses S. Grant (Richard Paul Fink), standing before large Confederate and Union flags as they correspond with each other before the signing of the truce that ended the war and freed the slaves, leaving Pittsinger’s statuesque Lee, resonant of voice and nuanced of acting, honorable in defeat.  But some of the poignancy of Act I stems from the fact that the good hopes and intentions of that truce were dashed, and in the opera’s first version, that wasn’t fully spelled out. Hampton went back and reworked the libretto into a play that incorporated the Civil Rights era; and Glass was eager to revise the opera as well. And the new material moves away the historical screen and reveals more about the creators themselves.  [Read more: The war that would not end: in “Appomattox,” race relations take the opera stage]  If you ever questioned the ability of Glass’s music to be emotional, the searing, swelling music in Act II around Johnson’s astonishingly powerful nationally broadcast message to Congress (“it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome”), should convince you. Not to mention the 2011 epilogue in which Edgar Ray Killen (Pittsinger, magisterial again), jailed for the 1964 killings of three civil rights workers, graphically describes their deaths as the music loses its patterns and explodes into angry wordless jabberings of rage. (Dante Santiago Anzolini, the conductor, deserves extra praise for pulling off a solid performance after learning this score on a few days’ notice when Dennis Russell Davies, who was scheduled to conduct, injured himself in a fall and was forced to cancel just before the start of rehearsals.)  And it’s no longer enough for Glass simply to incorporate the music of the past: with his own original version of “Glory, Glory Hallelujah” at the end of one of Martin Luther King’s speeches, he rewrites it, movingly.  What’s astonishing is how naturally and fluidly all this material allows itself to be depicted operatically. It perhaps comes as no surprise that Martin Luther King is a natural operatic figure, and Soloman Howard, young, charismatic, and vocally imposing with a rumble-the-floorboards bass, does him justice. But LBJ is profane, quirky, and given to using the toilet during official meetings (yes, it’s in the opera), and that both the work and Fox, singing his second president of the night, remain true to the historical record and the historical flavor of Johnson is something of a tour de force. And simply hearing the rage and pain of black civil rights activists front and center on stage, starting with the chorus that opens the act, might alone be enough to establish this as a significant opera, even if the choral writing weren’t so effective.  Thompson, the director, does a fine job keeping the narrative clear and moving on a relatively simple two-story set, and helping to develop an unusually rich collection of characters. Standouts among the really wonderful cast, apart from those already mentioned, included Melody Moore, who sang Mrs. Grant and Vi Liuzzo, a civil rights volunteer, with a clear shining voice; Chrystal E. Williams as Elizabeth Keckley and Coretta Scott King; Aleksey Bogdanov with a pitch-perfect oiliness as George Wallace; Anne-Carolyn Bird as the two first ladies, and Frederick Ballentine. Ballentine sang some of the most painful arias in the opera: a description of the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a civil rights activist, in Act II, and an account of the Colfax massacre of 1873, in which dozens of black men were slaughtered in cold blood.  Hampton’s libretto is an artful adaptation of his play, adding some choral and ensemble scenes that wouldn’t work in spoken theater and that also underline the parallels between the two acts. A pendant to the Colfax massacre epilogue to Act I is the epilogue to Act II, in which Pittsinger’s unrepentant Killen voices the hatred and threat that persists today. But as that sinister episode died away, the women returned to the stage, one by one, in an ensemble pleading for an end to sorrow and a rejection of racism and prejudice. It is as deeply moving as anything I’ve seen in opera. This opera runs for only a week; I will certainly be going again, and I think everybody should see it.  Appomattox runs through Nov. 22 at the Kennedy Center Opera House.',0
'COULD UTERUS TRANSPLANTS SOLVE INFERTILITY FOR SOME U.S. WOMEN? Mother playing with son. (Photo: Jupiterimages, Getty Images/Creatas RF)  A team of doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will soon begin implanting uteruses into women who were born without them.  The research study will involve ten women who have uterine factor infertility or cannot carry a child because they were born without a uterus; the Cleveland Clinic announced Thursday, The New York Times reported.  The announcement comes almost a year after doctors in Sweden reported that a woman successfully delivered a baby boy after she received a uterus implant. The then 35-year-old woman was born without a uterus and received the implant in 2013 from a 61-year-old post-menopausal woman, according to research published in the journal The Lancet.  The birth offered the first “proof-of-concept for uterus transplantation as a treatment for uterine factor infertility,” according to the report. Since the first transplant, the Swedish group has implanted nine uteruses that resulted in four live births, according to a statement from the Cleveland Clinic.  UFI affects thousands of women worldwide. Some women are born without a uterus and others can acquire UFI after a hysterectomy or a serious pelvic infection, according to the clinic.  “Women who are coping with UFI have few existing options,” Tommaso Falcone, a Cleveland Clinic doctor working on the study said in statement. “Although adoption and surrogacy provide opportunities for parenthood, both pose logistical challenges and may not be acceptable due to personal, cultural or legal reasons.”  The screening process for the study began in September.  A pool of 21-to-39-year-old women with UFI faced medical and psychological evaluations from experts at the clinic before they were admitted to the study, according to the statement.  Treating UFI with uterine transplantation is still "considered highly experimental,” Falcone said in a statement. He said the study will "explore the feasibility of this approach for women in the United States.”  The successful transplants in the Swedish study offer hope that the U.S. study will also result in the delivery of "healthy infants," Andreas Tzakis, Cleveland Clinic lead investigator, said in a statement. Tzakis said the implants are unlike other organ implants in that the purpose they serve does not last a lifetime.  “They are ‘ephemeral,’” he says. “They are not intended to last for the duration of the recipient’s life, but will be maintained for only as long as is necessary to produce one or two children.”',1
'WOMEN PERFORMED COMPARABLY TO MEN IN RANGER SCHOOL 1st Lt. Shaye Haver is one of the first women to pass Ranger School and earn the Ranger Tab. (Photo: Robin Trimarchi, Army)  Just days before completing his tenure, Army Secretary John McHugh defended the service’s decision to open its Ranger School to women and outlined data that showed female candidates performed just as well — and in some cases better than — their male peers.  McHugh was responding to allegations the Army eased the standards for the first women to complete the famously grueling course.  Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla., a retired lieutenant colonel and Ranger graduate, in September asked the Army to release documents relating to the performance of the first female students in Ranger School.  In an Oct. 20 letter to Russell, McHugh wrote that most student records are not retained after graduation. Instead, in a practice dating to 1952, the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade keeps a Ranger student's "Green Card," which verifies their attempt or successful completion of the course.  McHugh, who stepped down as secretary Nov. 1, likened it to a university transcript, which does not include "every test or paper that a student completes within a course."  "The Army takes exception to your characterization of this standard operating procedure as demonstrating a 'lack of due care' or the implication that this practice is somehow nefarious in either deed or motive," McHugh wrote in the letter, provided to Army Times by Russell's office.  Russell is working with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Armed Services Committee to obtain the records, according to a source in the congressman's office.  McHugh, in his letter, said the Army's gender-integrated assessment and subsequent opening of Ranger School was a decision "to allow women the opportunity to prove their own abilities within the Ranger course."

Shaye Haver, both West Point graduates, made history on Aug. 21 by becoming the first women to graduate from the storied Ranger School.  Maj. Lisa Jaster graduated on Oct. 16.  The women were part of a gender-integrated assessment of the school, which until earlier this year had been open only to men. In all, 19 women started Ranger School in April. Griest, Haver and Jaster were the only ones to complete the course.  Critics have for months accused the Army of lowering the standards of Ranger School or giving the female students an unfair advantage by allowing them multiple attempts at the school's three phases.  The Army on Sept. 2 announced that Ranger School is now open to all qualified soldiers regardless of gender. The first integrated class since that announcement kicked off Nov.2. The five women who started the course did not qualify to move on past the Ranger Assessment Phase, according to media reports.',1

'STUDENT PROGRAMMER WINS CERN OPENLAB INTERNSHIP The Large Hadron Collider at CERN. (Photo: CERN)  If you were tasked with choosing the ultimate grand prize for a young coder, what would it be?  A million dollars? Nah. Lunch with PC pioneer Bill Gates? Ho-hum. A job at Facebook? Meh.  Instead, it would likely be an internship at CERN openlab, one of – if not -- the most celebrated scientific research centers on the planet.  Based in Geneva, CERN houses the world’s largest particle physics lab, including its underground Large Hadron Collider (LHC), plus it’s the birthplace of the World Wide Web and home to CERN openlab, a renowned facility that encourages experimentation and collaboration to solve data-intensive challenges.  Mathieu Gravey, a 25 year-old PhD student in France, has won this coveted grand prize from the Intel Modern Code Developer Challenge, in partnership with CERN openlab.  “This is very, very exciting,” says Gravey, in a Skype video interview with USA TODAY. “It’s the opportunity for me to enter and work in one of the most famous international research centers.”  “I hope to meet interesting scientists, while acquiring and developing new skills under them,” adds Gravey. “Data analytics and simulation through cutting edge technologies are key fields of study for years to come.”  The challenge  Available only to students, this international coding contest challenged students to optimize code used to simulate brain development.  In particular, the software focuses on simulating the development of a normal and diseased brain, in order to identify the causes and potential treatments for neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.  This code is part of an existing CERN openlab research project, in collaboration with Newcastle University in the UK, which uses a “parallel programming” framework to help accelerate research among multiple scientists.  Students who entered the Intel Modern Code Developer Challenge were tasked with optimizing the code to improve its runtime performance, allowing researchers to make life-changing scientific breakthroughs faster.  Out of the roughly 2,000 students, representing 130-odd universities across 19 countries, Gravey submitted the fastest optimized code to win the 9-week internship at CERN openlab in 2016.  “Brain simulation is very interesting and it might be the future of informatics,” says Gravey. “Nowadays, smart processes are developing faster than ever before; the link between computer and biology is also getting stronger.”  Gravey maintains his biggest challenge was “diving into code that you haven’t written, plus this kind of algorithm is out of my field of study. These optimizations were performed through an iterative process.”  Perhaps he’s just being modest: according to Intel, Gravey improved the performance of the code by a whopping 32,000 percent -- from 45 hours to just over 8 minutes.  While the internship was the Grand Prize, 1st place winners earned a trip for a guided tour of CERN, while 2nd place winners get a trip to the 2016 Supercomputing Conference in Austin, Texas, where all winners were announced at this year’s event on Saturday.  The impact  “Young people bring new perspectives, enthusiasm and sources of inspiration to the technical development program,” says Maria Girone, who leads multiple experimental programs at CERN, which spans across more than 70 computing centers on five continents.  “The CERN openlab summer student program is an excellent way to train the next generation of computer scientists, some of whom will join CERN for longer periods of time -- as technical students, fellows or staff, for instance -- to tackle future challenges,” says Girone, who will take over the role of CERN openlab Chief Technology Officer beginning in January.  CERN openlab’s current CTO Fons Rademakers says partners like Intel give CERN’s scientists early access to tomorrow’s technology. “And for our partners, the testing and feedback provided by running their prototypes in CERN’s demanding environment can help correct possible design mistakes and help improve or better understand the product.”  “The CERN openlab summer student program brings young undergraduate students in contact with the latest and most advanced technologies, but also lets them work for nine weeks in a fast-paced, high-intensity, international environment, among world renowned scientists and engineers.”',0
'HRT COULD BENEFIT ONE MILLION WOMEN, SAYS NHS MENOPAUSE GUIDANCE NHS guidance on treatment of the menopause could lead to many thousands more women being offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the UK.  Related: A guide to the menopause  The guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), unveiled on Thursday, seeks to reassure women and their GPs about the safety of HRT. Studies suggesting a link with breast cancer, published in 2002 and 2003, led to a halving of the numbers of women taking the drugs.    Nice says the guideline could benefit more than a million women, many of whom could be prescribed HRT as the most effective treatment for debilitating symptoms, which include hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia and mood swings. The aim, says Nice, is for women to not suffer in silence and feel able to discuss their options with their doctor or practice nurse and make an informed decision.  Cancer scientists, however, have expressed concern that the effect of the guideline might be to rehabilitate HRT without sufficient recognition of the long-term potential harm. Prof Valerie Beral, an Oxford epidemiologist who leads the Million Women study which linked HRT to breast and ovarian cancer, told the Guardian that the risks were clear.  “About one million UK women are currently using hormones for the menopause,” she said. “Among them, about 10,000 extra breast cancers are estimated to occur in the next 10 years [40,000 in total, instead of 30,000 if the women had not used the hormones]. Also about 1,000 extra ovarian cancers are estimated to occur among them in the next 10 years [6,000 in total].”  Related: HRT media campaign underplays cancer risks, critics say  The Nice guideline committee says that women should be able to make up their own minds as to whether the benefits of relieving menopause symptoms would outweigh any potential risks. GPs or practice nurses should explain the risks, taking into account a woman’s individual circumstances. For example, breast cancer risks rise for those who are overweight or drink regularly.  “Women can cope with lots of side effects as long as they know about them,” said Prof Mary Ann Lumsden, chair of the committee. “The thing that really bothers them is if they haven’t been told.”    Dr Imogen Shaw, a GP with a special interest in gynaecology on the committee, said many women’s needs were not being met. “There are still a lot of women out there who have no idea there is any treatment.”  Shaw said women have told her of having to get up twice in the night to change the sheets, which are soaked with sweat, and of setting off for work after a shower, having dried their hair, only to arrive with a wet scalp and make-up running down their face. “If this is interfering with your life and you are not coping with these symptoms, go and talk to your GP or a practice nurse,” she said.  Related: What women should know about menopause  The guideline is the first on the menopause, which women go through at an average age of 51. An estimated 1.5 million women, around 80% of those experiencing the menopause, have some symptoms and 20% suffer more severely. One woman in 100 experiences a premature menopause before the age of 40. Those women would particularly benefit from hormonal therapy, Nice says.  It advises that tests for hormone levels to establish whether women over 45 have reached the menopause should be discontinued as they are unreliable and a waste of money. It says women who have had breast cancer and have menopausal symptoms should be referred to a specialist to see what treatment is suitable for them.  According to Nice, there are treatments other than HRT than can alleviate some, but not all, of the symptoms. These include cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for low mood. The guideline says antidepressants should not be given unless a woman has a diagnosis of depression. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as black cohosh and St John’s wort can help with some symptoms, but they warn that they do not come in standard preparations and that they can interact with other medicines.  The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which licenses drugs in the UK, recommends that the lowest effective dose of HRT should be given to women for the shortest possible time – advice Nice repeats.    Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, spokesperson for the Royal College of GPs, said the guideline would be very helpful to health professionals. “Many women are understandably concerned about the link that has been made between HRT and increased risk of breast cancer and other conditions, such as thromboembolism,” she said. “But it is important to remember that these issues are closely related to prolonged use of HRT in older women and these risks reduce substantially after treatment is stopped.  “Ultimately, any decision to prescribe HRT needs to come out of a discussion between GPs and individual patients about their unique circumstances, the pros and cons of treatments, and how to achieve the best possible health outcome.”  Dr Claire Knight, Cancer Research UK’s health information manager, said: “We know that using hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing breast, ovarian and in some cases womb cancer, but HRT can also offer effective relief from menopausal symptoms.  “What these new guidelines from Nice reiterate is that there are many factors at play in a woman’s choice to use HRT or not and women need clear, evidence-based information around the risks and benefits to help them make an informed decision. If you are considering starting or stopping HRT, speak with your doctor.”  ',1
'LEADING MEXICO CITY WOMEN DRAW UP 'MANIFESTO' TO IMPROVE THE CITY FOR ALL Political analyst Denise Dresser at the Frida Kahlo Museum  Tackling gender-based violence and unsafe public spaces are the main priorities for women in Mexico City, according to a diverse group of distinguished women who were invited to take part in a special discussion by the Guardian.  The group – which included actors, singers, political analysts, human rights activists, journalists and students who live and work in Mexico City – debated the biggest issues and challenges facing women in 2015. The event was held in the garden of Casa Azul where Kahlo, arguably one of the world’s most influential feminists and female artists, lived and created some of her best-known work.  The group agreed a list of priorities that will be presented by the Guardian to Patricia Mercado, secretariat of the Mexico City government. Mercado, a high-profile feminist politician and former presidential candidate, is one of the highest ranking female officials serving in the city government.  Guests at the ‘Mexico City for women’ discussion at the Frida Kahlo Museum.  The recommendations (which are not the official views of the Frida Kahlo Museum) urge authorities to develop and implement effective public campaigns targeting school children and adults, to help promote gender equality and to eradicate sexual harassment – which the group said is widespread in workplaces and public spaces, especially public transport.  Safe public meeting places, self-defence classes and better-lit streets are practical steps the city authorities could take immediately to improve security for women, the group concluded.    List of recommendations for the city  • The city’s government has a key role in promoting positive role models through its public campaigns, through equal gender representation in all spheres of public life, and by ensuring that there are safe public spaces for women to live, work and meet, within includes well-lit streets and safe transport operating to even the most marginalised areas.  • Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. Our panel seeks urgent action to tackle society’s tolerance of the harassment of women – in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity – and to challenge women’s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media.    • The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human-rights defenders – for example, the massacre in Navarte – must be a priority for the city’s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.  Actor Eréndira Ibarra speaking at the Frida Kahlo Museum  • Violence in the city, which includes feminicide and trafficking with Mexico City as a destination, must be acknowledged as a serious problem affecting women in the capital. Crimes against women must be investigated and prosecuted as laid out in legislation. Impunity must end, and victims must not be blamed, for example in the case of the member of staff who was killed in the Liverpool department store last November.    • Additionally, women feel too afraid to report crime, so there should be specially trained teams in the Public Ministry where women can go to report crimes with confidence.  • Women will never be safe while impunity continues. The city government should implement a zero-tolerance approach, starting with its own workforce, so that perpetrators – regardless of the seriousness of their crime – are brought to justice in a transparent and timely fashion.  • The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled – and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards.  • There are almost 250,000 domestic workers in Mexico City, more than 90% of them women. Yet almost none have contracts and, as such, no access to social security or security of work. The vast majority are not from Mexico City, many are indigenous women, and they suffer verbal, physical and sometimes sexual abuse.    • The consensus is that Mexico City should be a role model for the rest of the country, and the laws and policies towards equality which already exist must be implemented as a matter of urgency.

'STEVEN SPIELBERG’S BRIDGE OF SPIES – AND THE ROLE OUR FATHER PLAYED It is unusual for a woman of 66 to go to the cinema nine times to watch the latest Hollywood spy thriller, even if it stars Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance and is directed by Steven Spielberg. But when the film is a celebration of a forgotten moment of glory for a much loved father, it is easier to understand.  “I feel like my father has been in the shadows and is finally emerging,” Mary Ellen Donovan Fuller told the Observer. “The scene that means most to me personally is when Dad comes home and collapses on his bed with exhaustion. He really poured his life into his exploits.”  Bridge of Spies, out in the UK in November, tells the true story of the secret cold war negotiations that eventually led to the East German release of two Americans on a snowy bridge in Berlin in 1962.  The central character, James Donovan – Fuller’s late father, who is played by Hanks – is the Brooklyn insurance lawyer asked to defend a Soviet spy, Colonel Rudolf Abel, played by Rylance, who had been caught living undercover in New York. The decision to take up Abel’s unpopular case drew Donovan into a complex and covert world of international dealing in which his skills as an independent negotiator came to be relied on by the American government.  Bridge of Spies has already earned rave reviews, including five stars from the Guardian and plaudits from the New Yorker. The screenplay is by British playwright Matt Charman, who brought the story to Spielberg’s DreamWorks studios. His final script is a collaboration with Joel and Ethan Coen, and was inspired by Donovan’s book, Strangers on a Bridge, re-published last month.  The lawyer’s children, also portrayed in the film, now believe their crusade to win recognition for their father is over at last. For Fuller’s sister, Jan Amorosi, 72, the sight of Hanks playing their father on screen – struggling against the chill of the diplomatic climate and an icy winter in Berlin – proved too much. “I lost him when I was a young girl, so to see the harshness of the conditions he had to put up with, I started to cry and I couldn’t stop for about 20 minutes,” she said this weekend. “So many years of missing him. That shows the film has been well done, I suppose. It is very welcome and very overdue. He was a forgotten man.”  Amorosi, who is played in the film by Eve Hewson – the daughter of U2’s Bono – loves the film, although she pointed out that, while her family were verbally abused for supposed “Commie” sympathies, they were never victims of a violent attack, as portrayed in the film.  She recalls her father considering the job of defending Abel, a national bogeyman: “After he took the call he went outside to hit some golf balls, then came back into the house and said, ‘I am taking the case’. He was very decisive and liked challenges. But, of course, that was the beginning of all the trouble for us.”  Much of the plot chimes with her memories, such as the day in Brooklyn just before Donovan was called out to Berlin to oversee the spy exchange, when she noticed him rubbing his palms together nervously. “He was giving me a lift in the car and I asked what was going on. He admitted he was excited about something.” Later, staying in the Adirondack mountains with friends, the young Amorosi received a call from the CIA promising to take her to meet her father in a safe house in Washington as soon as he got back.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Donovan.  Her brother John, a 70-year-old Vietnam veteran from Connecticut, also remembers the secrecy. All the family, including their mother, Mary, were told Donovan was golfing in Scotland. “Before he went to Berlin he spent a few nights in London. I was at boarding school at the time and in a bit of trouble. But he sent me a note from Claridge’s hotel that he must have written right before he flew to Berlin. He told me I should relax and that things would work out. It was good advice.”  A little older than depicted in the film and, he said, less sceptical than portrayed, the son even accompanied his father on visits to Abel in jail.  “My father always explained Abel was ‘really all about Mother Russia’. He was an introverted type of person. We once sang him a version of the Christmas song with the words ‘Rudolf, the red-faced spy’. He laughed only a little and then talked about something else,” he said.  Donovan was so keen to see his father’s work acknowledged that he once wrote his own screenplay. “I kept running into dead ends, so I was delighted to hear from Charman and DreamWorks,” he said.  The children all gave Charman a sense of their father’s fair, but tough, approach. “He always wanted to get down to basics,” said his son. “In the beginning of the movie he is shown talking about a certain insurance case that actually came to the Supreme Court later in his career. Multiple liability in a road traffic case was the issue and I remember, because I was there, that he did hold up a newspaper headline and say, ‘It says there that one accident happened, not three’.”  Fuller, who lives in South Carolina, was “mesmerised by how much they captured my father”. “He had a great sense of irony and I love the fact it is a numbers game throughout the movie.”  For her elder sister, the film’s climactic scene on the Berlin bridge sums up her father’s trustworthy nature. When Rylance, the Soviet spy, steps from the car, he sees Donovan and is reassured.  “Back then we got a phone call from a representative in the middle of the night. Because it was all hush hush, my mother was confused. The CIA had even sent us postcards from Scotland,” said Amorosi. “When someone said we must be proud of my father, my baffled mother said, ‘Why? Did he get a hole-in-one?’”  Donovan was once to have been played by Gregory Peck, after his success playing lawyer Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird. Peter Ustinov had written a screenplay and Alec Guinness was to play Abel.  “My father and I were in London and we spent three days with Peck there, since he was filming Arabesque with Sophia Loren,” said Fuller. “He guided me privately through London Zoo one night!”  The family had already seen Donovan handle a secondment to the Office of Strategic Services, the American wartime intelligence operation, and a period in charge of visual evidence at the war crime trials at Nuremberg. His later career, before an early death at the age of 53 in 1970, was no less dramatic. Donovan negotiated with Fidel Castro for the release of prisoners during the Bay of Pigs crisis in 1961.  After nine cinema trips to Bridge of Spies, his youngest child is still not ruling out another. “I love going to the movie theatre to see my father on the big screen, before it joins the ranks of all the other films out there,” Fuller said.',0
'NEPAL: LAWMAKERS ELECT NATION’S FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Members of Parliament on Wednesday elected a veteran campaigner for women’s rights, Bidhya Devi Bhandari, to be the country’s first female president.

'UNDER PRESSURE, FEMININE PRODUCT MAKERS DISCLOSE INGREDIENTS Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dressed as a box of Tampax tampons, Stephanie Phillips, a 30-year-old vegan chef, danced on the sidewalk outside Procter & Gamble’s headquarters in Cincinnati.          Ms. Phillips and a small group of demonstrators were protesting the company’s use of chemicals in its feminine care products, much to the chagrin of the investors who were filing into the annual shareholder meeting.  “I think it’s really messed up that Procter & Gamble’s putting chemicals in feminine products and not letting anyone know about it,” Ms. Phillips said.  Consumer products companies may have been able to ignore these kinds of displays in the not-so-distant past. Now, however, health advocates can use social media platforms and other tools to galvanize public support — not just from demonstrators like Ms. Phillips, but from customers who can boycott a company’s products.  The increased pressure to respond to public concern has yielded some results.  Within the last few weeks, P.&G. and its rival Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kotex pads and tampons, began posting online the ingredients in their feminine hygiene products. While both companies list tampon ingredients on their packages, neither lists the ingredients for their pads on the packaging. P.&G. expanded the information it offered about the inclusion of synthetic materials, while Kimberly-Clark disclosed ingredients in its tampon applicators.  P.&G. also agreed to meet with Women’s Voices for the Earth after the group’s protest outside the shareholder meeting on Oct. 13.  The group had come armed with more than just costumes and banners: 35,000 people had signed a petition demanding that P.&.G. disclose feminine care ingredients and remove certain chemicals. The group had also created a spoof video as part of its campaign that has garnered more than 60,000 views online, according to its executive director, Erin Switalski.  “We had been trying to get a meeting with the company for a couple of years and they hadn’t been responding to our requests,” Ms. Switalski said. “If we aren’t able to get a dialogue, then we have to use some of these public pressure tactics to get these meetings to take place.”  Blogs, Facebook and Twitter have helped advocates like Ms. Switalski spread the word about their concerns. But manufacturers often grumble that public criticism of individual ingredients is not always justified, and forces them to make costly and time-consuming changes.  P.&G. and Kimberly-Clark say that their products are safe, and undergo rigorous scientific testing before they reach store shelves. And both companies say that transparency is a priority.  Photo  “Everything we do starts with the consumer,” a P.&G. spokesman, Damon Jones, said in an email. “It’s a balancing act — sharing enough to be helpful, but not too much that it is confusing.”  P.&.G. and Kimberly-Clark together account for the largest share of the more than $3 billion worth of tampons, panty liners and feminine wipes sold in North America last year, according to data from Euromonitor, a market research firm.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  While toxic shock syndrome is the best-known illness associated with tampons, advocates like Ms. Switalski are now more concerned with chemicals linked to cancer and allergies. Manufacturers have largely moved away from the ingredients linked to toxic shock syndrome since so-called superabsorbent products created a public health concern in the 1970s and 1980s.  The Food and Drug Administration still receives reports of illness relating to tampons, but says that instances of toxic shock syndrome are “rare.”  Some experts, like Dr. Philip M. Tierno, a professor of microbiology and pathology at New York University School of Medicine, argue that cotton tampons are preferable to those that use viscose rayon in the core. “Rayon” and “rayon fibers” are listed among the ingredients in some products on P.&G. and Kimberly-Clark’s websites.  “Even though viscose was the least of the bad superabsorbent ingredients, it’s still significant to some people,” he said. About four years ago, Dr. Tierno said he testified against a manufacturer in court in the case of a woman who lost all of her limbs because of toxic shock syndrome.  On its website, the F.D.A. says that “tampons made with rayon do not appear to have a higher risk of T.S.S. than cotton tampons of similar absorbency.”  But while the agency monitors certain chemicals linked to toxic shock syndrome and other ingredients, health advocates say that more oversight is needed, in part because companies are not required to disclose all the components that go into their raw materials.  Fragrances can be particularly problematic for consumers seeking more detailed information about their personal care products. Many personal care products companies simply list “fragrance” as an ingredient. (P.&G. describes it as “like those found in other women’s products.”)  Fragrances, however, can be made up of dozens of undisclosed chemicals that worry consumer advocates. Women’s Voices for the Earth says it found chemicals including styrene and chloroform in several of P.&G.’s feminine napkins.  Mr. Jones, the P.&G. spokesman, said the company disputed the group’s testing methodology, and he said that many of the chemicals listed in the report were commonly found in the environment.  Manufacturers say that their use of chemicals always falls well within safe exposure limits. But Ms. Switalski and others say that certain chemicals should not be included in products at all.  Complicating matters is the fact that companies often source fragrances from third-party suppliers, who guard their formulations closely.  Still, some companies have gone further than others: In June, SC Johnson, the maker of Glade, disclosed some of the most common fragrance ingredients used in more than 200 of its air fresheners, candles and scented oils.  “The new disclosures from Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark are a step in the right direction, and show that the concerns expressed by millions of women are being heard,” Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement. “But these disclosures are still very limited.”  For more than a decade, Ms. Maloney has pushed Congress to approve further research on feminine hygiene products. This year, she reintroduced a version of the same bill she introduced in 1997, that would direct the National Institutes of Health to study ingredients in tampons and other products.',1
'THE WAR ON CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT GOES DIGITAL Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As the problem of sexual assault on college campuses has become a hot-button issue for school administrators and federal education regulators, one question keeps coming up: Why don’t more students report attacks?          According to a recent study of 27 schools, about one-quarter of female undergraduates and students who identified as queer or transgender said they had experienced nonconsensual sex or touching since entering college, but most of the students said they did not report it to school officials or support services.  Some felt the incidents weren’t serious enough. Others said they did not think anyone would believe them or they feared negative social consequences. Some felt it would be too emotionally difficult.  Now, in an effort to give students additional options — and to provide schools with more concrete data — a nonprofit software start-up in San Francisco called Sexual Health Innovations has developed an online reporting system for campus sexual violence.  Students at participating colleges can use its site, called Callisto, to record details of an assault anonymously. The site saves and time-stamps those records. That allows students to decide later whether they want to formally file reports with their schools — identifying themselves by their school-issued email addresses — or download their information and take it directly to the police. The site also offers a matching system in which a user can elect to file a report with the school electronically only if someone else names the same assailant.  Callisto’s hypothesis is that some college students — who already socialize, study and shop online — will be more likely initially to document a sexual assault on a third-party site than to report it to school officials on the phone or in person.  “If you have to walk into a building to report, you can only go at certain times of day and you’re not certain who you have to talk to, how many people you have to talk to, what they will ask,” Jessica Ladd, the nonprofit’s founder and chief executive, said in a recent interview in New York. “Whereas online, you can fill out a form at any time of day or night from anywhere and push a button.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Callisto is part of a wave of apps and sites that tackle different facets of the sexual assault problem on campus. Some colleges and universities have introduced third-party mobile apps that enable students to see maps of local crime hot spots, report suspicious activity, request a ride from campus security services or allow their friends to track their movements virtually as they walk home. Many schools now ask students to participate in online or in-person training programs that present different situations involving sexual assault, relationship violence and issues of consent.  Institutions of higher learning are increasingly starting such programs to comply with statutes like Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by education programs that receive federal funding. Much of that activity comes in response to a letter issued in 2011 by the Department of Education that said colleges must create campuses free of sexual violence or face possible penalties. Schools are also trying to manage the reputational risks posed by students who accuse administrators of mishandling their sexual assault cases. As of Nov. 4, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights was investigating 175 cases involving sexual violence at 146 postsecondary schools.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some of the emerging tools seem like digital updates of “blue light” poles, the campus phone stations that college students have used for years to summon help or report an emergency — often after a problem has already occurred.  But Callisto presents itself as a more advanced reporting system that is particularly sensitive to students experiencing trauma. Ms. Ladd said she came up with the idea for a web-based reporting system after she was assaulted as an undergraduate at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.  “I went through the reporting process and found it disempowering and retraumatizing,” she said. “I started thinking about what would have been helpful.”  So far, the site has raised nearly $400,000 from Google.org, Google’s philanthropic arm, and other donors. This semester, two schools — Pomona College and the University of San Francisco — are testing Callisto. And a handful of students at the University of San Francisco have already used the site to file reports to school authorities.  But even if students choose not to officially submit their information, the site plans to share aggregated data to help administrators identify patterns and trends that could inform their prevention efforts.  “I think it could be helpful to see if there are reports on specific dates, if there are reports after certain events in San Francisco or on campus,” says Julie Orio, the interim vice provost of student life at the University of San Francisco.  The site also illustrates some challenges that start-ups may face in trying to apply insights from consumer behavior to entrenched societal problems.  One of Callisto’s features is its matching system — in which a student can ask the site to store information about an assault in escrow and forward it to the school only if someone else reports another attack identifying the same assailant. The point is not just to discover possible repeat offenders. In college communities, where many survivors of sexual assault know their assailants, the idea of the information escrow is to reduce students’ fears that the first person to make an accusation could face undue repercussions.  Ms. Ladd says students may be more motivated to come forward if they can help out other survivors.  “It means that someone is a threat to my community and not just me,” she says.  At least in its initial incarnation, however, the matching function has potential drawbacks. At one school testing Callisto, for example, the site asks students to submit just one piece of identifying information to match their attackers: a link to the assailant’s Facebook page. That protocol sends students who have just experienced sexual assault to Facebook accounts where they are likely to see photos of their attacker — and the friends they might have in common.  “That almost builds in a deterrent to reporting,” says Keith Hiatt, the director of the technology program at the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. “You start to envision the consequences that could arise from reporting.”  Ms. Ladd said she and her team had consulted with sexual assault survivors during the site’s development process and they did not find the Facebook identifier problematic. She added that the team worked with college administrators to determine the matching identifier, like a school email address, that would work best for their campus.  The larger issue here is that, in acknowledging a culture in which people who consider filing sexual assault reports reasonably fear they will not be believed, the Callisto matching function may inadvertently reinforce the societal message that survivors are safer sitting on their accounts until someone else is assaulted and comes forward.  “It might allow people who have survived sexual assault to get over the first-mover disadvantage, but it may also codify an entrenched attitude that women need to have corroborating evidence to be believed,” says Mr. Hiatt of the Berkeley Law School. “We have to be a little sad that we live in a world where something like this is necessary.”',1
'AFTER OUTCRY, IRELAND ADJUSTS ITS CORPORATE TAX DRAW Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  CORK, Ireland — As lord mayor of this quiet seaside city in southern Ireland, Chris O’Leary seems to have a situation most other local politicians can only dream about.          Blue-chip international companies like Apple, Dell and IBM have all set up shop in and around this city, filling newly built office blocks near the city’s port and sprawling office parks in the suburbs. The companies set up shop here for the cheap workers, business-friendly lawmakers and — above all — Ireland’s low corporate tax rate. Since the height of the financial crisis in 2011, the region’s unemployment rate has fallen by more than four percentage points, to 9.9 percent, or roughly the national average, according to government statistics.  “What has made us different is how we’ve gone about our business,” said Mr. O’Leary, 55, in his city hall office, decorated with a black-and-white photo of President John F. Kennedy’s visit here in 1963 and a copy of the city’s centuries-old charter.  That way of business is now under attack, though — and the potential benefit of Ireland’s most recent tax strategy for attracting companies is in doubt.  In recent years, other European countries have accused the country of acting like an unfair low-tax haven. The European Commission, for example, is investigating whether Ireland gave Apple a preferential tax deal that broke the region’s tough state-aid rules. While lawmakers and the company have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, the country is already phasing out the most controversial loopholes.  Ireland has since turned to a new inducement: a low tax rate on revenue generated from patents and other intellectual property held in Ireland. Such an incentive — announced last month to be 6.25 percent, or half of the country’s corporate tax rate — could be most attractive to patent-heavy industries like technology and pharmaceuticals.  But many tax experts say the benefits will be significantly smaller than many had expected, particularly for global tech giants.  Because of recent changes to global agreements, Ireland must limit what type of intellectual property can be included in these low-tax structures, known locally as a “knowledge development box.” Such restrictions have been demanded by several European countries, particularly Germany, which raised concerns that Ireland and other countries would turn to such structures to unfairly lower corporate tax rates.  Under international law, Ireland and other countries like Britain and potentially the United States can offer the tax breaks only on intellectual property derived from research carried out in their national borders. Much of the research and development for technology companies is done outside Ireland. So revenue from global patents like those linked to Google’s search algorithm, many of which were developed in the United States, will not be eligible for the reduced tax treatment.  “It won’t be much help to many international companies,” said Anna Scally, head of the technology, media and telecom practice in Ireland at KPMG, an accounting company that has helped global companies with their Irish tax arrangements.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some local policy makers are concerned that Ireland’s ability to entice international companies may be hampered by the restrictions on the country’s latest tax proposals. But others cite Ireland’s flexible (and increasingly multicultural) work force and its close ties to the United States as the reasons global companies, particularly those from the tech industry, will continue to knock on Ireland’s door.  “We’re closer to Boston than we are to Berlin,” said Mr. O’Leary, Cork’s mayor. “Companies aren’t just coming for the corporate tax rate.”  While lawmakers often play down its importance, Ireland’s 12.5 percent tax rate (versus 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States) has been a mainstay in the country’s decades-long strategy to attract the world’s largest companies. With few natural and manufacturing resources, Ireland and its politicians instead have turned to one of the world’s lowest corporate tax rates as the country’s primary competitive advantage in the global economy.  The bet has paid off. The country collected $4.2 billion in corporation tax in the first nine months of the year, or almost 50 percent more than the period last year, according to government records.  “We see tax as just part of the overall package that we can offer companies,” Richard Bruton, Ireland’s minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation, said in an interview.  Companies do not appear to be shying away from the country. Representatives from Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook declined to comment on Ireland’s new tax mechanism. But just last week, for instance, Apple said it would increase its work force in Cork by 20 percent, to 6,000 employees, by 2017. IBM and Pfizer, the drug maker, also recently announced plans to expand their Irish operations.  Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, a lobbying group that represents many of the companies, said there were other incentives, including tax breaks of up to 25 percent on research and development conducted in Ireland, that still were available to international companies.  “The knowledge development box is not the only show in town,” Mr. Redmond said.  And experts say global pharmaceutical companies, many of which operate research and development facilities in Ireland, could benefit from the country’s 6.25 percent tax rate on revenue derived from locally held intellectual property more than their counterparts in the tech industry.  “The low rate eventually could encourage companies to carry out R.&D. here in Ireland,” said Joe Tynan, head of tax at PricewaterhouseCoopers in the accountancy firm’s Dublin office.  Still, for regulators who have tried to limit Ireland’s tax advantage, the restrictions placed on the country’s knowledge development box represents a victory in the global push to close unfair tax loopholes. Some companies in Ireland had lobbied for a wider definition of what type of intellectual property, especially linked to online advertising and search patents moved from other countries to Ireland, that could be included in the tax mechanism. Those efforts, though, failed.  Pascal Saint-Amans, tax director at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been charged with drafting new standards to avoid multinational tax avoidance, said these low-tax mechanisms had to be linked solely to intellectual property from research and development conducted within a country’s borders.  Otherwise, Mr. Saint-Amans added, international companies could unfairly move patents between countries in a bid to pay the lowest amount of tax.  “The greater amount of global intellectual property you include in these mechanisms, the more likely it is that they will be harmful,” he said. “The goal should be to attract real R.&D. to a country, not to compete just on tax rates.”',0
'GENE AMDAHL, PIONEER OF MAINFRAME COMPUTING, DIES AT 92 Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Gene Amdahl, a trailblazer in the design of IBM’s mainframe computers, which became the central nervous system for businesses large and small throughout the world, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 92.          His wife, Marian, said the cause was pneumonia. He had been treated for Alzheimer’s disease for about five years, she said.  Dr. Amdahl rose from South Dakota farm country, where he attended a one-room school without electricity, to become the epitome of a generation of computer pioneers who combined intellectual brilliance, managerial skill and entrepreneurial vigor to fuel the early growth of the industry.  As a young computer scientist at International Business Machines Corporation in the early 1960s, he played a crucial role in the development of the System/360 series, the most successful line of mainframe computers in IBM’s history. Its architecture influenced computer design for years to come.  The 360 series was not one computer but a family of compatible machines. Computers in the series used processors of different speeds and power, yet all understood a common language.  This allowed customers to purchase a smaller system knowing they could migrate to a larger, more powerful machine if their needs grew, without reprogramming the application software. IBM’s current mainframes can still run some System/360 applications.  The system was announced at IBM’s annual shareholders meeting on April 7, 1964, in Endicott, N.Y., a village near Binghamton where the company had opened a facility early in the 20th century.  At the meeting, Thomas J. Watson Jr., then chairman and chief executive, singled out Dr. Amdahl as the “father” of the new computer. “I remember it very clearly,” Marian Amdahl said in an interview. “Gene was so proud of that.”  Michael J. Flynn, a computer scientist at Stanford University and former colleague of Dr. Amdahl’s at IBM, said the 360 series “set the design philosophy for computers for the next 50 years, and to this day it’s still out there, which is incredible.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “This same instruction set,” he added, “is still bringing in billions of dollars for IBM.”  Dr. Amdahl is remembered at IBM as an intellectual leader who could get different strong-minded groups to reach agreement on technical issues.  “By sheer intellectual force, plus some argument and banging on the table, he maintained architectural consistency across six engineering teams,” said Frederick P. Brooks Jr., a computer scientist who was the project manager of the System/360 and is now at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Photo  Dr. Amdahl’s business instincts and ambitions manifested themselves in 1970, when he left IBM to build a company to rival it. At the time, the market for mainframe computers belonged almost exclusively to IBM.  With funding from Fujitsu, he formed the Amdahl Corporation, setting up offices in Sunnyvale, Calif.  “We took about three weeks to do an analysis of the formidable task of competing head-on with IBM,” Dr. Amdahl said in a 2007 interview with Solid-State Circuits Society News.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  His idea was to build machines compatible with hardware and software for the System/370, the successor to the System/360. He pointedly named it the 470 series, and in 1975 his company shipped the first of the machines. It proved faster and less expensive than IBM’s comparable computers.  By purchasing an Amdahl computer and so-called plug-compatible peripheral devices from third-party manufacturers, customers could now run System/370 programs without buying IBM hardware.  The Amdahl Corporation was not the first to make IBM-compatible computers, but it managed to compete successfully against IBM where large companies like RCA and General Electric had failed.  Amdahl also benefited from antitrust settlements between IBM and the Justice Department, which required IBM to make its mainframe software available to competitors.  By 1979, the year Dr. Amdahl left the company to start another venture, Amdahl had more than $200 million in annual revenue and 22 percent of the mainframe market.  (Fujitsu bought the remaining interest in Amdahl in 1997 and made it a wholly owned subsidiary. It has since been dissolved as a stand-alone entity.)  Dr. Amdahl also formulated what became known as Amdahl’s Law, which is used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum improvement in speed using multiple processors.  Gene Myron Amdahl was born on Nov. 16, 1922, in Flandreau, S.D., to parents of Norwegian and Swedish descent. He grew up on a farm and attended a one-room school through the eighth grade. Rural electrification did not reach his town until he was a freshman in high school.  After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he tried to join the military, but the Selective Service turned him down, deeming his farming skills more important. “They’d drafted so many of the youth that there weren’t enough people to harvest,” he told an interviewer in 1989.  Dr. Amdahl finally joined the service, the Navy, in 1944, and taught radar at naval training centers around the country. In 1946 he married Marian Quissell, who grew up on a farm four miles from his.  He received his bachelor’s degree in 1948 from South Dakota State University, in Brookings, where his wife worked as a secretary. She had dropped out of Augustana College in Sioux Falls, S.D., after her freshman year to go to work to help pay for her husband’s education. In 1952 he received his doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  It was in graduate school that his interest in the nascent field of digital computers took root. For his Ph.D. thesis, he drafted a design for what became known as the Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer, or W.I.S.C., an early digital computer.  Dr. Amdahl was recruited by IBM after a branch manager in Madison visited him at the university and offered him a job straight out of graduate school.  After the success of the System/360 project, Dr. Amdahl moved to California in 1964, weary of what he described as “the time and politicking demands” at IBM’s corporate headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. In California, he managed an IBM engineering laboratory for six years before starting Amdahl in Sunnyvale, in the heart of Silicon Valley.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dr. Amdahl also encountered both technical and business disappointments. One was Trilogy Systems, which he created after leaving Amdahl in 1979. Trilogy set out to build an integrated chip that would allow mainframe manufacturers to build computers at lower costs. It raised more than $200 million in public and private financing. Yet the chip development ultimately failed.  In 1987 Dr. Amdahl started the Andor Corporation, hoping to compete in the midsize mainframe market using improved manufacturing techniques. But the company encountered production problems, which, together with strong competition, led it to bankruptcy in 1995.  Besides his wife, Dr. Amdahl is survived by two daughters, Delaine Amdahl and Andrea Amdahl; a son, Carlton, who was vice chairman of Trilogy; a brother, Lowell; and five grandchildren.  Despite his business failures later in life, Mr. Amdahl’s reputation for technical brilliance endured. Dag Spicer, senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., compared him to two of the industry’s greatest computer architects.  “He’s always been right up there with Seymour Cray or Steve Wozniak,” Mr. Spicer said, “with real cachet in the technical community.”',0
'JOE’S CRAB SHACK TO TEST NO-TIPPING POLICY Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Following in the footsteps of the Danny Meyer restaurant group, Joe’s Crab Shack, a Houston-based chain with more than 130 locations nationwide, announced on Wednesday that it would test a no-tipping system in one of the largest trials yet of the policy.  The casual seafood chain will adopt the change at 18 locations, its parent company, Ignite Restaurants, said in a statement. The company indicated that menu prices would rise to absorb the added labor costs, but said the increase would be “typically less than the average 20 percent service tip.” It didn’t say when the new policy would begin.  “We believe that consistently great service should always be included in the menu price, so we are taking the responsibility for paying the service staff,” Ray Blanchette, chief executive, said in the statement. “I personally believe tipping is an antiquated model and you have seen most businesses in America migrate away from it over the last 50 to 100 years.”  Other restaurants have made similar decisions in recent years, notably the Union Square Hospitality Group, the company owned by Mr. Meyer that announced in October that it would eliminate tipping for 1,800 employees at its 13 restaurants by the end of 2016.  Servers are sometimes paid wages well under the minimum wage, relying on tips to make up the difference. But the system can be volatile, enabling servers to make a mint on a busy night or take home little when business slumps. For customers, tipping can represent an annoying math problem, even if they appreciate the ability to reward good service or protest shortcomings.  The policy would put Joe’s Crab Shack “above the fray” in minimum wage debates, Mr. Blanchette said in a conference call last week, according to The Orange County Register. He also predicted that it would be preferred by employees.  “It’s expected to result in an improved team atmosphere, a significant reduction in turnover and greater financial security for the employees,” he said on the call, according to CNBC.  Responding to the Union Square Hospitality Group’s decision in October, the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a group that has fought for the elimination of tipping, said it hoped others in the industry would follow suit.  “These forward-looking employers who are taking the high road to profitability through policies that ensure a living wage for employees will show the nation that dignity and profitability are not mutually-exclusive ideas at America’s restaurants,” Saru Jayaraman, the group’s co-founder, said in a statement.  Restaurants give up a significant tax credit by eliminating tips, and the potential effect on menu prices is uncertain. Drew Nieporent, the owner of 10 restaurants in New York City and London, said in October that diners might be unwilling to foot significant price increases.  “Tipping is a way of life in this country,” he said. “It may not be the perfect system, but it’s our system. It’s an American system.”',0
'ANDREW RICHARDSON, THE MAN WHO NAMED A MAGAZINE AFTER HIMSELF Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  When Andrew Richardson visited Japan last month, customs officials confiscated copies of his magazine, Richardson, for its sexually explicit photos. About a year ago, his Instagram account was temporarily suspended for showing a part of a woman’s derrière.          And at the New York Art Book Fair, held in September at MoMA P.S.1, Mr. Richardson sold a zine with images of duct-taped women held hostage by frat boys. While wandering the fair, he bought stickers from the feminist art collective Guerrilla Girls. “They would put a stake through my heart if they knew who I was,” he said.  Mr. Richardson enjoys being a provocateur.  After a career as a fashion stylist for clients like Calvin Klein and Valentino, he is arousing attention on his own. The current issue of Richardson magazine features a mostly nude cover photo of the rap vixen Blac Chyna, pornographic prison drawings and male nudes by the photographer Bob Mizer.  His streetwear label, also called Richardson, includes logo-speckled T-shirts, bombers and balaclavas. It has been spotted on Rihanna and Kate Moss but remains an in-the-know signifier for skaters, art kids and downtown types. His eclectic vision of erotica comes together at his Lower East Side boutique; a second store opens on Dec. 1 in East Hollywood in Los Angeles, next to a theater that shows X-rated movies.  “Andrew likes to live and act in the margins,” said David Sims, the British fashion photographer who recently worked with Mr. Richardson on a book for Supreme, the influential skating company. “He’s an obsessive, most often for something that is so obscure that I can’t help but suspect the fix is on the journey as much as the object of his desire.”  On a recent Monday afternoon, Mr. Richardson lounged on a sectional couch in his Forsyth Street apartment overlooking Sara D. Roosevelt Park. He was wearing his company’s red sweatpants and glasses with a rose-tinted frame. Afghan rugs depicting grenades and Kalashnikovs covered the floor. A photo of P. Diddy captioned with an Oscar Wilde quote adorned the wall.  “I’m 49 years old and I’m still living a somewhat adolescent life,” Mr. Richardson said, in a pacifying British accent. “You know, I’m sort of happy about it. As you get older, you can get really restrained by fear of your future.”  Born in Marlow, England, a town outside London, Mr. Richardson is the son of a civil engineer father and a stay-at-home mother. He described himself as an adventurous child. “It was always me and some friend who were drunk at 11 years old at a wine tasting at the rugby club,” he said. (He has been sober for a decade, he said.)  By 19, he was managing the Kenzo men’s store in London and immersed in a night-life scene that included experimental Mutoid Waste Company art parties and the embryonic stage of raves. “We walked around like dandies living in council flats,” Mr. Richardson said of his interest in fashion. “You were obsessed with saving everything and buying one pair of Comme des Garçons trousers on sale.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the late 1980s, he moved to New York to work for a company that designed men’s wear for Charivari, the au courant boutique that closed in 1999. While staying in a loft on West 26th Street, Mr. Richardson met several photography assistants. “These kids were making much more money than me, flying all over the world and surrounded by beautiful women,” he said. “So I was like, ‘That’s what I should do.’”  He found his entre through styling. While assisting the photographer Steven Meisel (whom Mr. Richardson calls his “father in the business”), he assembled tear sheets with mononymous supermodels. “We worked with Linda, Christy and Naomi,” Mr. Richardson said. When working on Madonna’s 1992 book, “Sex,” he familiarized himself with New York sex shops and began integrating rubber clothing and S&M themes into his aesthetic.  Richardson magazine, which is published annually and has a circulation of 3,500, has navigated the same murky boundaries between art and obscenity. The first issue, released in 1998 by Little More, a Japanese publisher, included a spread with Jenna Jameson, the adult film star, and Richard Prince’s “Spiritual America,” showing 11-year-old Brooke Shields in a bathtub.  With contributors like Terry Richardson (no relation), the magazine has suffered consequences for being risqué. Last year, a Nobuyoshi Araki cover photo of a nude woman with a noose around her neck prompted the website’s credit card processor, Stripe, to sever ties temporarily.  “You can’t be a full examination of the human id,” Mr. Richardson said. “You can’t be your id. You have to have the conscious filter of what’s appropriate and where the line is.”  Mr. Richardson’s clothing label started as an afterthought to a 2003 T-shirt collaboration with Supreme. It has expanded to include items like car club jackets ($629) and carpenter pants ($275), but the line’s most popular item is a $22 T-shirt that reads “Richardson Hardware” with the address of his second-floor Broome Street storefront.  Other designs riff on familiar American iconography, like a tweaked version of the Narcotics Anonymous emblem. “We’re into subverting the U.S. Marines logo, for example,” he said, “because the drill instructor from ‘Full Metal Jacket’ is like a sexual dom.”  After the book fair, Mr. Richardson and a small cohort of friends and assistants encircled a table at Sapphire Gentlemen’s Club, a Manhattan strip joint beneath the Queensboro Bridge.  As Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz’ “Get Low” thundered, he flung bills toward the stage and received a lap dance from a woman wearing nipple rings and thigh-high stockings.  A bald, thick-necked patron, who said his father was an electrician, inquired about the “Local 143” insignia on Mr. Richardson’s jacket, which, naturally, was from his own line. “It’s a Lower East Side union, bro,” was the reply.',0
'WHY I’M PROUD TO BE A ‘TOKEN MAN’ The marketing industry is rife with advice on how to be a good leader: hire people better than you; anything related to shoulders and giants; bring in fantastic people and learn from them, and so on. That’s all great, but it doesn’t drill down to what really matters or even begin to approach the more immediate, contemporary issues of equality and diversity.  This is all about to change, thanks to an initiative called Token Man.  The initiative aims to give men a better understanding of the challenges women face at work, through a series of interviews and events, flipping the traditional ratio of men to women. This is sorely needed. It might not be palatable, but it’s a fact that this industry has long been castigated as a bastion of sexism and misogyny. We may not quite be stuck in the “Mad Men” days of typing pools and blatant abuse, but no one could claim we have enough Peggy Olsons.  Famously, or should I say infamously, just 3% of creative directors are female. This week’s equal pay day was a stark reminder that women still earn an average of 15% less than their male counterparts. These are awful statistics, caused in part by the myopia of our industry, searching only in expected places when recruiting, and the pub-chatter reliance on personal networks and little black books. They’re also easy to hide from with the usual lazy excuses: “It’s not just us.” “We’d hire more women if we could find them.”  Why not do a bit more work and be a bit more interested in the world? After all, it is our industry’s job to connect; to influence and be influenced by the world around us. It’s what we get paid to do and it’s what we’re expected to be. Quite honestly, if we’re not going to drive change, be brave or look in those unexpected places, then who will?  I’m committed to fighting the battle and driving change wherever I can. I’m a proud dad to three very special kids (two of them girls) and in that typical new-dad cliche, I want them to experience a world free from worry, bias or prejudice. I want my girls, and my son, to achieve whatever they want and to become whatever they want to be. Scientist. Artist. Astronaut. Chef. Creative director. Racing driver. Butcher. Baker. Candlestick maker. If that’s what they want, I want them to know that I’ll be proud of them regardless and that I’ll be cheering them on, whatever choices they make.  I want them to be able to make those choices without the obstacles, pressures and boundaries (all of them lazy, avoidable or reversible) that, while we might not like to admit it, we see all the time, all around us. We all have the ability to remove our blinkers and do something about these issues. We just need to start acting differently and making different choices.  Obviously, I’m proud of my kids. I’m going to support them, now and always. But I also want them to be proud of me and share my pride in being a Token Man. It gives me a flag to wave and a banner to carry, and, most of all, a constant reminder to avoid the easy, lazy way forward. We can all create change if we want to.',1
'THERE IS A MUSEUM OF FEMALE EMANCIPATION: THE WOMEN’S LIBRARY I was sorry to read that Deborah Orr thinks there has never been “a museum dedicated to the evolution of female emancipation” (Forget the V&A, 7 November). The Women’s Library, whose original collections were those of the female suffrage petitioners of 1866, is an accredited national museum as well as a library and archive, and its contents cover changes in women’s lives from the 18th century to the present day. It was forced to leave its purpose-built and Heritage Lottery-funded premises in London Metropolitan University in 2013, but is now housed at the LSE, where a new exhibition space on the ground floor of the main Library building is open to all. Exhibitions in 2016 will celebrate women’s work for peace and equality, as well as the 150th anniversary of the 1866 petition to parliament which led to the founding of today’s Fawcett Society.

'INTO THE BADLANDS: SLAVERY SCI-FI WITH A KUNG FU EDGE THAT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE What’s the name of the show? Into the Badlands.  Is this a remake of the Sissy Spacek movie? Ha. No, that was just Badlands. And there is nothing out there like Into the Badlands.  When does it premiere? Sunday, 15 November, at 10pm EST, right after The Walking Dead, which means AMC is really invested in its success.  It’s on AMC, so it has to be a prestige drama with lots of antiheroes going through existential angst in the suburbs, right? Oh, golly, how wrong you are.  So, what is this thing, then? You know, just your standard martial arts show about warring barons and their minions in a post-apocalyptic America. Well, actually, we don’t know if there was an apocalypse or if it’s in America. It sort of looks like 1886 but it also sort of looks like the future, so who knows. It could be a galaxy long, long ago and far, far away.  That’s not really helping. What exactly happens? So, seven different barons, who are sort of like plantation owners, rule this country. They each make all their money off of one crop. The baron we know the most about is Quinn (Martin Csokas), who grows opium poppies, for instance. He has both a bunch of “cogs”, who are the slaves who work the fields, and highly trained “clippers”, who are his enforcers. There are also marauding packs of “nomads”.  This is making a bit more sense. Quinn’s main clipper is a guy called Sunny (Daniel Wu), whom he found orphaned as a child and treats as a member of the family. In the series opening, Sunny finds MK (Aramis Knight), a cog who has been kidnapped by a bunch of nomads. It turns out he has some mysterious dark powers that make him special.  Each sequence is incredibly choreographed, like a tap-dance number with 40 dancers  OK, you lost me again. And didn’t you say something about martial arts? Yes. Sunny, the clippers and the barons all are masters of martial arts, the over-the-top kind you see in Hong Kong action movies where it seems like they can fly.  Is the fighting good? It is the absolute best fighting you’ve seen on TV. It’s sort of in the Kill Bill style, where each fight is a dramatic tableau set in a picturesque location – a rainy street, a factory, a forest glen – that quickly fills with bloody corpses and snapped limbs. Each sequence is incredibly choreographed, like a tap-dance number with 40 dancers all doing the same thing at once.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ally Ioannides as Tilda in Into the Badlands. Photograph: Patti Perret/AMC/AMC  This show sounds insane. It is absolutely bonkers and there is nothing else like it on television, which is what makes it so appealing to me. Yes, Sunny is your classic TV antihero who has to choose between serving his baron and escaping with his pregnant girlfriend, Veil (Madeleine Mantock). There is a bit of a Game of Thrones vibe too, with this universe that is like ours but very different. Also, each baron has his own color scheme, banner and allegiances, as with the different houses on Game of Thrones. But even so, there is no real comparison to this show.  It may be different, but is it good? I think so, yes, with some caveats. I’m a big fan of comic books, and watching Into the Badlands is kind of like starting a new comic book series. You’re welcomed into this fully immersive universe with its own rules, words, fashion and way of doing things. The viewer just has to accept a lot of different things and go along for the ride. If any of the elements seem too outlandish for certain viewers, the show is probably going to lose them, but those willing to submit to the world-building will be thoroughly rewarded. Also, the show doesn’t really elevate the comic-esque material as The Walking Dead does. This show is happy to just be a genre piece, a bit of grindhouse fare on an arthouse channel.  The way the show is shot is a little odd. There are ornate sets and costumes, but they’re all rendered in a sort of saturated color scheme that reminds me mostly of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, the one with Kevin Sorbo. So, yeah, it looks a little cheap, even though it clearly isn’t. Combine the sci-fi elements and the artistic decisions and you end up with something that looks, well, cheesy.  That said, cheesy isn’t necessarily bad. Empire can be mighty cheesy. So can The Walking Dead. So can just about every superhero movie. There is nothing on Earth outside of the Kraft factory that is cheesier than Full House, and that is getting a revival on Netflix. There is something about cheesy done right that is simultaneously comforting and exhilarating, and I think Into the Badlands finds that sweet spot.  Come on, a show this crazy can’t be all good. Yes, there are some problems with it. Some of the acting isn’t great and some of the dialogue could use some fine-tuning, but most of what you’re seeing is engaging and interesting. And, for the first time in a long time, I have absolutely no idea where this show is going. So, like wearing a caftan as a wedding dress, it may not win points for quality, but it definitely scores for ingenuity and nerve.  So you think I should watch this show? I gave it the season pass on the DVR, just because I’m curious how this thing is going to play out, and the fight scenes are worth the price of admission. That said, this isn’t for everyone. If you like comic books, Doctor Who, Kill Bill, or things that really make you scratch your head, give this a whirl. More conservative viewers should probably sit this fight out.  Into the Badlands starts Sunday 15 November at 10pm EST on AMC in the US, and Tuesday 17 November on Amazon Prime in the UK',0
'‘KINGDOM OF DAUGHTERS’ IN CHINA DRAWS TOURISTS TO ITS MATRILINEAL SOCIETY Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  LUGU LAKE, China — A young man clad in a white shirt, black pants and red belt suddenly scrambled up the side of a log house and slid feet first into a second-story latticed window.          “This is how Mosuo men would climb into the ‘flower room’ of the women,” Ke Mu explained to visitors as the triumphant swain stuck his head out the window of the flower room, or private bedroom, and waved his hat.  It was morning in the lakeside village of Luoshui here in southwestern China. On a narrow side street, dusty from hotel construction nearby, a group of young workers, including Ms. Ke, 18, was preparing for another day of cultural pageantry at the Mosuo Folk Museum.  Their task is to showcase the traditions of the Mosuo, a minority ethnic group said to be the country’s last matrilineal society, where children take their mothers’ surnames and daughters are preferred to sons.  A fascination with such traditions has led to a booming tourism industry in this once-isolated region.  Lured by the promise of spectacular natural beauty and exotic cultural experiences, hundreds of thousands of visitors, mostly Chinese, are making the journey to Lugu Lake, nestled on a plateau in the mountains between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.  Photo  Those numbers are expected to rise with the opening of a local airport this month and later an expressway connecting Lugu Lake to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan.  In response, a number of family-run hotels have popped up along the lake’s pristine blue waters. Visitors can watch residents perform traditional dances in colorful costumes and can take boat rides on the lake as young Mosuo men serenade them with love songs in Naru, the Mosuo language.  All around the village are signs that read, “Welcome to the Kingdom of Daughters.”  Continue reading the main story Yellow R. 250 mileS SICHUAN Chengdu Lugu Lake CHINA Lijiang Dapo YUNNAN VIETNAM MYANMAR LAOS South China Sea THAILAND  Lively as its traditions seem, however, the Mosuo community is facing a crisis. As its interaction with the wider society increases, residents and outside experts fear that the group’s unique cultural practices are facing a grave threat.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Experts say that the population of Mosuo in the Lugu Lake region, estimated to be about 40,000, is decreasing as more young people marry outside the group or move to larger cities for work. And without a written language, Mosuo culture is particularly vulnerable to disappearing.  Even within the community, young Mosuo are increasingly choosing marriage over the foundation of Mosuo culture: the centuries-old practice of tiesese (pronounced tee-say-say). Known in Mandarin as zouhun, or walking marriage, tiesese is an alternative to matrimony in which men visit women at night to fulfill the need for procreation and sexual gratification. Traditionally, a Mosuo woman might have several tiesese relationships during her life, sometimes simultaneously. Though this has changed as outside values of monogamy and lifetime partnership seep in.  Photo  “It would be great to get married one day,” said Lu Ru, 34, who is in a tiesese relationship. “Can you imagine loving someone that much?”  With tiesese, sex is kept separate from family, and men and women are generally expected to spend their lives in the houses in which they were born. As a result, sexual partners rarely occupy the same dwelling. Household harmony is valued above all else, including conjugal relationships.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In traditional Mosuo culture, family life is structured around the basic social unit, known as the “grand household,” in which children are raised by their mother and her side of the family. And while children typically know their biological fathers, maternal uncles are responsible for taking on the paternal role, helping to raise and provide for their sisters’ children.  Continue reading the main story Today’s Headlines: Asia Edition Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.  Men stay with their mothers, and the several generations live in the grand household together.  According to Chuan-Kang Shih, an expert on the Mosuo and an anthropology professor at the University of Florida, the system is underpinned by a fundamental belief that women are more capable than men, mentally and even physically. The Mosuo also believe that everything people value in the world came from a woman, not a man. All male deities are secondary to their patron goddess.  “The system makes so much sense when you think about the overall ways in which family systems have to navigate between sexual desire, stability, domesticity and claims for children,” said Judith Stacey, a professor of sociology at New York University who has written about the Mosuo.  Photo  “But it depends on a lack of mobility, which is why now, with all of this inequality as well as economic and geographic mobility, it can’t survive as a system,” Professor Stacey said.  According to historical accounts, life in the Mosuo community was relatively stable for hundreds of years. Starting in the Yuan dynasty, which ruled China from 1271 to 1368, the Mosuo were governed by a native chieftain system with a rigid social hierarchy. While they lived alongside several other ethnic groups who practiced marriage, almost all Mosuo continued to practice tiesese.  That changed in 1956, when the chieftain system came to an end and the Mosuo were incorporated into the recently established Communist system. Under Communist rule, the social ranks were abolished and the Mosuo were subject to continuing efforts to change what the Communists saw as their “backward marriage customs.”  Photo  These efforts culminated in 1975 with an official “one husband, one wife” campaign, which required Mosuo sexual partners to marry and live under the same roof.  Since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, the government largely receded from everyday life among the Mosuo. But experts say the increased scrutiny left many members of the group with a conflicted attitude toward tiesese.  “In the late 1980s, the Mosuo were either very defensive or denied the existence altogether of the so-called walking marriage,” Professor Shih said. “Then in the mid-1990s, when tourism began in the Lugu Lake area, they began to see it as capital to attract tourists, and they started to boast about it.”  Photo  Not everyone is mourning the waning of tiesese. One recent afternoon, Lu Zuo, 78, a retired farmer, sipped yak butter tea on the floor beside the hearth in his longtime tiesese partner’s home in the Mosuo village of Dapo, about a 45-minute drive from Lugu Lake. A small white bust of Mao Zedong sits above the hearth flanked by two red vertical banners inscribed with Buddhist prayers in Tibetan script.  Mr. Lu watched as his daughter and two sons set the table for lunch. Before eating, the daughter, Song Na, 49, took a small piece of potato from the table and placed it on a black stone at the back of the hearth to honor the family’s ancestors.  After lunch, she left her brothers and nieces to clear the table and walked across the street to an empty yard where she would not be overheard.  She talked about her longtime tiesese partner and their two daughters, both of whom were working in Lijiang, about seven hours away by car.  “They probably won’t enter a walking marriage,” Ms. Song said. But what mattered most to her was not the tiesese tradition but its underlying values.  “As long as they come back to take care of the household,” she said.',1
'AFTER A MASS EXTINCTION, ONLY THE SMALL SURVIVE Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story  From sharks to giraffes, many of Earth’s biggest and most magnificent species are threatened with extinction. A new study of the fossil record indicates that once large vertebrates disappear, evolution cannot quickly restore them — for tens of millions of years, most animals remain small.          The study, published Thursday in Science, emerged from research carried out by Lauren Sallan, a paleontologist at the University of Pennsylvania.  Studying fish that lived during the Mississippian Period, from 359 million to 323 million years ago, she noticed that they were substantially smaller than their ancestors.  “It piqued my curiosity,” Dr. Sallan said in an interview. “Why are these fish so small?” (She earned a nickname from her fellow paleontologists: the Sardine Queen.)  Other paleontologists had previously noticed that some groups of species seemed to shrink in size over time. It’s called the Lilliput Effect, after the fictional island in Jonathan Swift’s “Gulliver’s Travels” inhabited by tiny people.  Researchers found that the Lilliput Effect often occurred after abrupt and widespread extinctions. Dr. Sallan’s fish appeared to fit the pattern: They shrank after a mass extinction at the end of the Devonian Period, 359 million years ago.  Scientists suspect that this mass extinction was triggered by a global chill that brought glaciers all the way to the tropics. The deep freeze was brutal both for fishes and for the early land vertebrates (known as tetrapods) that were just starting to clamber around on feet with toes. An estimated 96 percent of all vertebrates became extinct at the beginning of the Mississippian Period.  Still, scientists have been uncertain about how important the Lilliput Effect was. The cases documented by paleontologists had been limited to small groups of species and typically the researchers only looked at fossils over a limited stretch of time, before and after mass extinctions.  Some thought these Great Shrinkings might be illusory; small-bodied fossils, they noted, might be more likely to be preserved than big ones. Dr. Sallan decided to put the Lilliput Effect to a stronger test.  Working with Andrew K. Gallimberti, then an undergraduate at Kalamazoo College, Dr. Sallan studied every known vertebrate species that lived in both the Devonian and Mississippian. With online databases and digitized fossil scans, Dr. Sallan and Mr. Gallimberti estimated the body lengths of 1,120 fossilized animals.  After the mass extinction 359 million years ago, the scientists found, vertebrates were smaller on average than before, and they stayed that way for the next 36 million years.  Photo  Peter J. Wagner, a curator of paleobiology at the Smithsonian Institution who was not involved in the study, said one of its strengths was the broad stretch of time it covered.  Previous studies were “more like snapshots of what things were like before and afterwards,” he said. “This study goes much further.” Dr. Wagner, who wrote a commentary in Science accompanying the new study, said the work was also important because it dissected the Lilliput Effect, examining trends in different groups of species.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some groups simply stayed at the same diminished size during the Mississippian, while others steadily shrank. Sharks, for example, dwindled from over a yard long to about just a few inches. Our own tetrapod relatives shrank from the size of dogs to the size of cats or smaller.  That’s not to say that all vertebrates got tiny — a few actually got bigger. One group of monstrous fish called rhizodontids, for example, included some species that grew to nearly the size of a killer whale.  But these groups of big vertebrates didn’t produce many new species. Instead, they dwindled in diversity until they became extinct altogether. That’s why we watch “Shark Week” instead of “Rhizodontid Week.”  Dr. Sallan said that these patterns could help explain the Lilliput Effect. Small vertebrates may have had an evolutionary edge that made them less likely to become extinct at the end of the Devonian. Perhaps they grew quickly and reproduced early in life, making them less vulnerable to ecological disruptions.  But even after the deep freeze was over, large species didn’t bounce back for a long time. Dr. Sallan suspects that this was because the world’s ecosystems remained decimated for millions of years, posing an enduring challenge to the survival of vertebrates. “They had to do more with less,” said Dr. Sallan.  Small vertebrates recolonized the planet, adapting to the ecological niches left empty by the mass extinctions. Filling those niches took an unimaginably long period of time, Dr. Sallan suggested. Only after easier niches were full did some vertebrates start evolving new patterns of growth to adapt to different niches, reaching bigger sizes in the process.  Dr. Sallan sees a worrying parallel between the extinction of large vertebrates 359 million years ago and their slow disappearances today.  If they become extinct in large numbers, she said, there’s no guarantee that evolution will bring back big species in short order.  “It’s likely that the global ecosystem will snap into this alternate state,” said Dr. Sallan — one dominated by small vertebrates. “They’ll be happy to stay there for millions of years.”',0
